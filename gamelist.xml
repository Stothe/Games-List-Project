2020 Super Baseball (c) 1991 SNK Corporation.

There is no longer conventional baseball in 2020. The Super Baseball designed by the SUPER BASEBALL ASSOCIATION has been very popular and is the best sport. However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player&apos;s ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball.

Finally, a fair game in going to be played at &quot;CYBER EGG&quot;!

FUTURISTIC SUPER BASEBALL, NOW PLAY BALL!

2020 Super Baseball:
1. Futuristic Graphics
2. Select 1 of 12 individual teams of men, women &amp; robot players.
3. Fast paced game with new rules!

Acrobat Mission (c) 1991 Taito Corp.

A great vertical scrolling shoot&apos;em up game.

At the year 2100 A.D. Humans were exterminated by their own self-destructive nature leaving behind the consequences of environmental degradation on earth and were forced to escape to Mars leaving a bio-computer for environmental recuperation of earth to preparing the blue planet for future recolonization. But one day a half a century after humans arrived, mars was attacked by strange flying objects. To fight these enemies, the director general of the Defence Agency organized the task force army and started quickly the dogfight with invaders to neutralize the invasion. 

The operation was called &apos;Acrobat Mission&apos; as it exceeded the technical limits of the pilots.

The players takes controls on one of two surviving fighters pilots, &apos;Jet&apos; a male pilot and &apos;Nova&apos; a female pilot and both flying the Icarus, a fast and powerful space-fighter, which comes equipped with a Standard laser. Two more weapons are available throughout the game - the wide shot (W) which spreads out in front of the ship and the Hurricane shot (H) which fires clusters of rotating balls of energy. Holding the fire button charges up a special attack and each weapon features a different energy blast and damage factor. The ships can also hold a maximum of two smart-bombs, one under each wing - although they can be activated by the players, they also do fall off easily and can be detonated by enemy shots. Interestingly, the Icarus can&apos;t collide with other ships or any part of the scenery - instead, it bounces off and only suffers damage from enemy shots. However, once the shield is depleted, the ship will fly out of control for a few seconds and grant the players a last chance to inflict damage to any remaining enemies before it explodes.</desc>

Sonic Wings 2 (c) 1994 Video System.

The first sequel to the superb vertically scrolling shoot-em-up &quot;Sonic Wings&quot;, players once again take control of a Jet fighter aircraft and take to the skies to destroy enemy jets, boats, helicopters, gun emplacements and huge end-of-level bosses. The graphics are every bit as accomplished as those of the prequel and the game delivers a good level of challenge.

The end-of-level bosses change from game-to-game; a nice touch that adds variety to an already solid game.

Players can choose to play as any one of eight different fighter pilots, each of which pilots a different jet:
* American F-117A Nighthawk piloted by Robo-Keaton. 
* American A-10 Thunderbolt II piloted by Mao Mao. 
* Japanese Fighter-Support X piloted by Hien. 
* Japanese F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain Silver. 
* International F-14 Tomcat piloted by Cindy and Ellen. 
* International YF-23 Black Widow II piloted by Spanky. 
* French Rafale piloted by Steve. 
* British Sea Harrier FRS2 piloted by Bobby.</desc>

Sonic Wings 3 (c) 1995 Video System.

The third game in this excellent series adheres to the solid shoot-em-up template set down by its predecessors. The player takes on the role of a Jet Fighter aircraft pilot whose mission is to combat world terrorism. The object of the game is to fly from country to country and destroy all opposition around the world, before flying into outer space to combat the menace responsible for the terrorism. Each pilot has his own storyline that ties in with the game.

One enemy shot destroys the player&apos;s plane and releases a special power-up that the plane may have been carrying. If the player&apos;s final ship is destroyed, all power-ups and extra bombs are released and can be collected if the player chooses the &apos;continue&apos; option, or if a second player is still active. However, on the final mission in Outer Space, the player is forced to start again at the beginning of the space mission, unless 2 players are active.

Sonic Wings now features an array of 10 selectable pilots:
American Vought F4U Corsair piloted by Robo-Keaton. 
American Northrop P-61 Black Widow piloted by the Blazers. 
Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero-Sen piloted by Hien. 
Japanese Aichi M6A1 Seiran piloted by Mao Mao. 
Soviet Il-2 Stormovik piloted by Chaika and Pooshka. 
Soviet Polikarpov I-16 piloted by Spanky. 
German Dornier Do-335 Pfeil piloted by Malcolm (&apos;Pfeil&apos; is german for &apos;Arrow&apos;) 
German Junkers Ju-87 Stuka piloted by Kowful and River. 
British Westland Whirlwind piloted by Alex and Pictus. 
British Fairy Swordfish piloted by Cindy and Ellen. 

There are also 2 secret planes (see the TIPS AND TRICKS section for details):
The Aka Usagi (Red Rabbit) piloted by Kotomi. 
The Diabloon piloted by The Man.

Planes Spec.:
Vought F4U Corsair can have 3 power-ups and 5 bombs.
Northrop P-61 Black Widow can have 3 power-ups and 7 bombs.
Mitsubishi A6M Zero-Sen have 3 power-ups and 5 bombs.

痛快GANGAN行進曲 (c) 1994 SNK Corp.
(Tsuukai Gangan Koushinkyoku)

1-on-1 fighter featuring 8 selectable characters.

The game&apos;s major innovation is the ability to walk into the background, in a similar manner to side-scrolling beat &apos;em ups such as &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; or &quot;Final Fight&quot; because of this, unlike many other 2-D fighting games, the game uses one action button to jump, it also does not use the &apos;D&apos; button, (Which many of SNK&apos;s other fighters did), only 2 action buttons are used for attacking (punch and kick), instead grappling and grabbing opponents (Pressing the A &amp; B buttons simultaneously) is the focus of the gameplay, opponents can counter being grabbed, as well as break free. Also featured is weapon play, again similar to beat &apos;em ups, weapons can be picked up and thrown, or used in special &amp; standard attacks. Weapons are thrown in by background crowd members who will step forward to toss them into the ring. Another (strange) innovation of the game is that characters start to sweat -graphically- after a while.

Characters have unusually high health for the genre, with multiple, different coloured, health bars in one bar similar to a method of health bars used for boss characters in games of the time, in addition to this, each character has a &apos;Crazy Meter&apos; at the bottom of the screen, which is built up as characters attack, this gives the character a special, often very bizarre, attack that will kill the opponent outright, known as the GanGan Attack in Japan, and the Crazy Attack in the US.

Battles are joined by irreverent, sometimes humorous pre-fight banter from characters, the dialog differs depending on whom each opponent is, and a clashing of 2 small images of the characters eyes, which clash in the center of the screen.</desc>

Airgallet (c) 1996 Banpresto.

The player controls a fighter jet and shoot enemies in the air and on the ground, collects power-ups, and defeat bosses to advance levels. The player must collect four power ups to upgrade their weapon. There are four weapon types: L, a laser weapon, S, a support drone, M, a tracing missile, and F, gatling Fire, a spread-out vulcan bullet shot.

Four levels of power-ups are available for each weapon, however each level requires four power up tokens be collected. There are also two special &quot;bomb&quot; weapons available for collection - green Energy Spark for a screen-covering swarm of lower-power bombs and blue Thunder Drive for a narrower and more focused attack. The Energy Spark clears all bullets from the screen, while the Thunder Drive only clears bullets that actually touch the blast. This blast starts momentarily atop the player, but quickly moves forward a short distance and stays stationary for a few seconds before dissipating.</desc>

Alien Arena (c) 1985 Duncan Brown.

Player 1 (Thor) and Player 2 (Zespar) are battling it out in the Alien Arena. The game is timed, with 2 minutes for every 25 cents inserted, regardless of your choice of 1-player or 2-player. More time can be purchased at any time before the timer reads &apos;:00&apos;.

In a 1-player game you are Thor, with controls on the right, and the computer plays Zespar, on the left. In a 2-player game each of you chooses a set of controls. When time runs out in either game, it reverts to a &quot;play as long as you can keep alive and possibly winning extra lives&quot; 1-player game. If it started as a 2-player game, whoever is winning when time runs out is the one who gets to battle the computer.

The basic theme of the game is &quot;capture the flag (while protecting your own)&quot;. You can assemble offensive and defensive aids by picking up &apos;pieces&apos; strewn about your half of the playfield. The pieces are color-coded, randomly created and distributed, and different objects require different numbers of pieces to assemble. Once you start assembling an object, you must finish assembling it (pick up enough pieces for it) and place it... or &apos;flush&apos; the pieces you&apos;ve picked up so far. Flush is mostly used for when you accidentally picked up the wrong color piece... or when you don&apos;t have the required pieces to assemble the rest of the object. A status bar shows what object is under construction, and how many more pieces are needed. Only one object can be assembled at a time. Once it is assembled, you must carry it to where you want to place or launch it and press the &apos;place&apos; button.

There is a delay at the beginning of each round before the flags appear, and then a further delay before the midfield barrier comes down. Use this time to start assembling an offense or defense or both (this keeps the opponent from just starting each round by making a suicide dash for your flag). When the flags do appear, their placement is random, but within a small distance from the back wall of your half of the arena.

A round ends when an opposing flag is captured by a player, or when a player is destroyed by one of his opponent&apos;s offensive or defensive objects. There are all sorts of nuances to how the objects behave, how they score, etc.</desc>

Alien Syndrome (c) 1987 Sega.

Alien Syndrome is a overhead-view run and gun game for one or two players in which a number of Mankind&apos;s space ships and bases have been overrun by an alien race, who have taken the human inhabitants hostage.

Players control two soldiers named Ricky and Mary and must fight their way through large eight-way scrolling levels to rescue their captured comrades. Once a set number of hostages have been rescued, an exit opens and players can pass through it to fight the end-of-level guardian. Once the guardian is defeated, play moves onto the next stage.

A time-bomb is automatically set at the start of each stage, which must then be completed before the bomb&apos;s timer runs down. Failure to finish the level in time results in the death of the player characters. Weapon upgrades and maps of the current level are available at certain points and are accessed via hatchways in the wall.

Alien Syndrome consists of 6 full stages plus a 7th final mini-stage, consisting solely of a fight to the death against the game&apos;s final, massive guardian.</desc>

Players take on the role of either Ellen Ripley (in the single-player game) or Corporal Hicks (in the two-player game) and must shoot their way through the alien-infested levels of the LV426 base to make their escape together with &apos;Newt&apos;, the little girl who survived the alien invasion of her settlement.

Players begin the game armed only with a pulse rifle but will have opportunities to upgrade to other weapons, including flamethrowers and grenade launchers. Bombs can also be found that cause greater damage to the enemies. Each player life starts with eight health points which deplete upon contact with either an alien or an enemy projectile and once all health points are lost, the player loses a life. Each stage ends with a Boss encounter, with the game&apos;s final boss being the Alien Queen herself. 

As well as the standard side-scrolling stages, intermittent into-the-screen stages also feature that have the players riding atop the Marines&apos; APC vehicle, shooting the hordes of aliens that swarm towards it.

As well as the standard Aliens and Face-huggers from the original film (that now come in a variety of different colours), there are many enemies that were created only for the arcade game and have never appeared elsewhere in the Alien franchise. These include flying aliens and mutated humans, as well as all end-of-stage bosses prior to the Alien queen.</desc>

Astérix (c) 1992 Konami Company, Limited.

Asterix is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players and is based on the French comic-book series, &apos;Asterix &amp; Obelix&apos;. Players fight as either Asterix the Gaul or his best friend, Obelix, as they take on the might of the oppressive Roman Empire. 

Asterix and Obelix each have standard jump/attack controls, as well as a dash attack activated by tapping the joystick forward twice then pressing the attack button. Each character also possesses a powerful spinning arm attack, this is activated by holding the attack button for a short while until the character&apos;s face turns red, after which players must release the button. If the button is held down for too long, the character gets out of breath and takes a few seconds to recover.

The heroes&apos; main foes are Roman legionaries and fat - occasionally horseback riding - centurions. After an enemy has been beaten enough to fall to the ground, he can be picked up and attacked again, the nature of the attack is dependent on which character picks them up; Asterix will spin the stunned enemy above his head, whereas Obelix smashes him repeatedly into the ground. These stunned enemies also act as temporary weapons, as they will cause damage to any other enemies they come into contact with.

Occasionally, a beautiful blonde lady called Panacea appears carrying a basket. If Asterix or Obelix walk up to her, she will give them a kiss, restoring some health and temporarily paralyzing any on-screen legionaries with embarrassment. Health can also be replenished by picking up the piles of red apples that litter the stages.

Asterix features eight different stages, called &apos;acts&apos;, all with a boss fight at the end. Every act from the second one onwards is based on a different book from the Asterix series and contains signature locations, objects and themed enemies, including pirates, thieves and Indian guards. 

Bonus levels appear after certain stages, featuring either a timed chariot race, or a timed barrel-smashing sequence on board a sailing ship. The game&apos;s eight different stages are:
* First Act: Village
* Act 2: Asterix in Egypt
* Act 3: Asterix in Britain
* Act 4: Asterix and the Admirable Panacea
* Act 5: Asterix in Spain
* Act 6: Asterix and the Magic Carpet
* Act 7: Asterix Vs Caesar</desc>

Athena (c) 1986 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

This is a pretty hard platform game where you take the role of Athena fighting your way through different worlds inhabited by all kinds of different enemies, ranging from moving pears to huge golems and flying devils.

You start out with nothing more than your feet to fight with and no more protection than Athena&apos;s underwear (she actually loses her dress in the intro to the first world) but can collect a huge number of different weapons and armour, as well as a great number of power-ups ranging from the usual more-power-for weapon or armour, through boots that allow her to jump higher and wings for flying, to one where Athena becomes a semi-god and actually growths to twice her usual size and gets a huge burning sword and full armour.

The worlds are filled with stone blocks that can be smashed when searching for secrets and items, as well as several levels connected by ladders or other means of transportation.

Athena is a great game, and will give even the most hardened platform-player a real challenge, for it is NOT an easy game, even with the dip switches in &apos;Easy&apos; mode.</desc>

Atomic Robo-Kid (c) 1988 UPL.

In the 21st century, a blast of cosmic radiation bombarded Terra-12, a deep-space outpost of Earth, hideously mutating all transplanted life. A fleet of savage beings followed the radiation wave and invaded the planet, and began the systematic destruction of all remaining sentient life. Years of battling the alien &apos;governors&apos; have gone by, and now only one hope survives to avenge the desperate Terran colonists.

The player controls the Atomic Robo-Kid through six stages of increasing difficulty, facing an alien &quot;governor&quot; boss, which are so large as to be considered levels themselves, followed by a &quot;duel&quot; level against other Robo-Kid sized robots. Many levels branch into others, giving the player the choice over which zone to enter next, increasing replayability.

Robo-Kid can collect four different weapons. Whichever weapon is selected is lost when Robo-kid loses a life. In addition to his default gun, Robo-Kid is able collect powerups for a shield that activates on enemy contact, rapid fire, and speed powerups. The player can also encounter a friendly dinosaur-looking robot that sells weapons and shields to Robo-kid using extra lives as currency.</desc>

Avenging Spirit (c) 1991 Jaleco.

Avenging Spirit is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which game&apos;s hero is ambushed by a criminal syndicate, who kidnap his girlfriend and shoot him dead. The hero&apos;s spirit is summoned by his girlfriend&apos;s father and given a mission to save her from the mysterious syndicate that now holds her hostage. Only then can he rest in peace.

At the start of the game players choose to possess one of four enemy characters to begin their quest. When the possessed body is killed, providing there is a living enemy nearby (other than that of a boss) the player can possess them and continue playing. Each time this is done, it costs the player &apos;spirit energy&apos;. Should the hero die when there are no enemies close by for the player to possess; the game is over.

The hero must fight his way through six stages to infiltrate the syndicate&apos;s base, collecting a key on stages 2, 5, and 6 as he progresses. If he has all three keys upon reaching the final leg of Stage 6, the hero can unlock the girl&apos;s cell, possess her and help her to fight her way out of the base. If not, he must abandon her and face the syndicate&apos;s leader alone. Once the syndicate&apos;s leader is defeated the base blows up, so with the latter option, the girl is not saved.</desc>

爆突 機銃艇 Baraduke II (c) 1988 Namco.
(Bakutotsu Kijuutei - Baraduke II)

Bakutotsu Kijuutei is the sequel to BaRaDuKe, which was released three years earlier. As in the original game, the player must take control of a spaceman in a bio-suit (who is a caricature of a Namco employee) while fighting the strange-looking Octy and saving the one-eyed Paccets - except this time Player 1 is Takky and Player 2 is Hommy. The Paccets that the spacemen collect during the stage now come in two different colours (yellow and white), and will circle around them, and the yellow ones will also add to their scores at the end of the stage (for 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 7650 points in succession) instead of featuring in the bonus game, which now only happens before a boss stage; however, the white ones will not, because they cannot be killed. If a yellow Paccet is accidentally shot or killed by an enemy, he will explode and send his eyeball flying - and if the player catches the eyeball he will receive a single point. Several new enemies have also been introduced (one of which, the &quot;Block Brain&quot;, first appeared in Beraboh Man, and another, the &quot;Black Paccet&quot;, is an evil version of the Paccets); the boss for the thirtieth stage, &quot;Dark Paccet&quot;, is also an enormous evil version of the Paccets. If the player defeats Dark Paccet on his first try, the game shall not end - instead, six more stages will have to be played, and if a player wins the game (regardless of if it ends on Stage 30 or 36), he will not be able to enter his name on its high score table. There are now four different types of capsules; as a general rule, the yellow ones contain Paccets, while the red ones contain Baganns (the Pac-Man-like aliens from the original title), the blue ones contain shot powerups, and the green ones contain speed powerups. It is also now impossible to move backwards (like in Super Mario Bros.) - but if the player dies, he will be sent back to the beginning of the stage (unlike in the original, where he would restart in the place where he died) and be reprimanded by the &quot;Paccet Ojisan&quot;, who also appears for the start of some stages to give him advice.</desc>

    <desc>Arcade Video game published 28 years ago:

Batsugun (c) 1993 Toaplan.

A vertically scrolling shoot&apos;em up game. As is the standard with most arcade shooters, the player controls their ship with a joystick and two buttons. One button (Fire) shoots the main guns, and the other button (Bomb) releases a smart bomb that spreads huge energy balls all around the player&apos;s ship.

As enemies are destroyed, the player gains experience points that are separate from the score. For every 288 experience points gained, the main gun will &apos;level up&apos;, becoming much stronger. This is analogous to experience points and leveling up in role playing games. The weapon can only level up twice, so after it has achieved its maximum level, 288 experience points will grant the player an extra bomb.

The player can also grab P icons to increase the power of the current level gun. A maximum of five &quot;P&quot;s can be collected per experience level; getting more after this gives extra points instead.

Collecting B icons increases the number of bombs, to a maximum of 7.

Apart from destroying enemies, points can be gained from collecting golden V-shaped medals. After the level is finished, 3000 points are awarded for every small one, and 5000 points for every large one. If the player&apos;s ship is destroyed during a level, all medals collected are lost.</desc>

The Berlin Wall (c) 1991 Kaneko.

The player takes control of a boy who must use his hammer to break the blocks that form part of the colourful, platform-strewn levels that form each stage. These holes act as traps for the many patrolling monsters and once an enemy has fallen into a hole, the player must then use the hammer on the enemy to make it fall through the hole and down to the platform below - causing it to change into fruit, which can then be collected. This game is a reworking of the 1980 classic, &quot;Space Panic&quot;.</desc>

The player controls the &apos;Humanoid&apos; and must navigate a number of robot-filled rooms; each with up to as many as eleven, laser-firing enemy robots. The Humanoid can be killed either by a single shot from a robot, by running into a robot, by running into a wall of the maze, or by being touched by the player&apos;s nemesis, &apos;Evil Otto&apos;.

To advance through the game, players must fight their way through each room to an opening at one of the far walls. Each robot destroyed is worth 50 points and while it&apos;s possible to progress without killing every robot in each room, destroying all of them will earn the player a per-maze bonus (worth ten points per robot). The game has an impressive 64,000 mazes, with each level designed to be more difficult than the last.</desc>

Big Fight - Big Trouble in the Atlantic Ocean (c) 1992 Tatsumi Electronics Company, Limited.

A side scrolling beat &apos;em up featuring fighters: Gear, Kevin, and Zill.

There&apos;s an extra game mode named &apos;Battle mode&apos;, where you can choose your character from the 8 available (the 3 heroes, plus the 5 bosses already unlocked) and challenge a friend or the CPU in a Vs battle. Note: this option requires two players before you start: after 1 of the 2 players is KO, the winner can continue to play against the CPU.

All the playable characters have their own special moves, you must find them.

- TRIVIA -

Big Fight was released in December 1992 ans was the last arcade video game made by Tatsumi. They focused on Photo Booths after this game.

* At the half of the first stage, you can choose the course for continuing your way: in this way, you can modify the level sequence and the relative difficulty for those.

* After you&apos;ve beaten a boss at the end of the level, he will be available as a playable character, and you can also choose him to play the next level: every time you beat a new boss, this will be added to the playable characters rooster. These characters are:

Bio-Ship Paladin (c) 1990 American Sammy Corp.

While the game is essentially a standard horizontally scrolling shoot&apos;em up, it has an innovation that makes it unique in the genre. The player flies a spaceship (specifically, a bioship) which has the standard forward guns to be found in all horizontal scrollers, but it also possesses a weapon that can be manually targeted with a crosshair, in the same manner as in the game &quot;Missile Command&quot;. This allows the player to fire in any direction with pinpoint accuracy, and adds an extra level of strategy to the game.

Biomechanical Toy (c) 1995 Zeus.

Biomechanical Toy is an eightway-scrolling platform shoot-em-up set in a world of magically-animated toys, in which the magical pendulum that animates the toys has been stolen by the evil &apos;Scrubby&apos;, a criminal once imprisoned for trying to steal the pendulum who has managed to escape and take his revenge. The player takes on the role of Inguz and is tasked with freeing the few remaining good toys that are trapped throughout the stages, while destroying or avoiding the many evil toys that now patrol the kingdom. 

Inguz carries a basic, single-firing pistol, although additional ammo clips can be found throughout the game that upgrade the gun with either extra shot power, automatic firing or exploding bullets. When the gun&apos;s current ammo clip is empty, Inguz will take a moment to reload, leaving him vulnerable to attack. Freed toys will give help to Inguz by providing additional firepower for a short time.

Inguz begins each stage and each new life with a full health meter of eighty units, but food can be found that will replenish the meter. The player can lose a life either by running out of health, falling off the bottom of the screen (or into a hazard, such as a lava pit), or by running out of time. Clearing each stage awards bonus points based on both remaining time and health units.

Checkpoints - indicated by red flags - are located at certain points throughout the stages. In the event of losing a life, play restarts from the last checkpoint reached. Objects with Inguz&apos;s face on them (such as wooden chests and balloons) release bonus items when shot. 

An abstract, oriental-looking face occasionally forms part of a level&apos;s platform which, when shot, releases balloons which can in turn be shot for bonus items. A giant flying hat also occasionally appears and will drop bonus items when shot. Smart Bombs can also be found at certain points that, when run into by Inguz, will damage or destroy all enemy toys on screen.</desc>

Export release. Game developed in Japan. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese release entry; &quot;Black Dragon&quot;.

- TRIVIA -

Black Tiger was released in August 1987 outside Japan. It is known in Japan as &quot;Black Dragon&quot;.

Although they are similar in nature, there are also significant differences between the export version, Black Tiger, and the original version, Black Dragon. Globally, the export version is an easier game. Below are some of the more apparent differences found in these Export versions: 
* Items less expensive.
* Less pitfalls (rocks).
* Less and easiest enemies.
* Bosses easiest.
* Points given by the Red Dragon, Red Demon Warrior, and Black Dragon are differents (see scoring section).
* The bonuses are changed (different value and position).
* The secret item locations are the same but the symbols for them are different.

A bootleg of this game was released by Dragon with the same name. 

Isiah Johnson holds the official record for this game with 2344150 points on May 31, 2008.

- SCORING -

Scoring is exactly the same as in the original Japanese version except for the following bosses: 
Dragon (red): 10,000 points 
Demon Warrior (red): 150,000 points 
Dragon (black): 10,000 points.

Blasteroids (c) 1988 Atari Games Corp.

Blasteroids is a 1 or 2-player update of Atari&apos;s seminal &quot;Asteroids&quot;, where the object of the game is to clear all sectors of the asteroids and enemy ships. Once this task is completed, the player goes on to battle Mukor - the &quot;boss&quot; asteroid who rules all galaxies - and destroy him.

The player&apos;s ship appears first in the center of four vortices, he or she must chose which vortex they wish to enter, which then transports them to a sector of their chosen star system.

Unlike in &quot;Asteroids&quot;, the player ship has a finite amount of fuel which must be replenished as often as possible. This is achieved by destroying specifically-colored asteroids which turn into collectible crystals. Not all sectors contain the crystal-bearing asteroids, however, and if the player runs out of fuel, a ship is lost. The game contains three different ship configurations and the player can switch between them at any time during a level. The three configurations are: Speeder (small and fast, but weak), Fighter (medium speed and strength) and Warrior (large and strong but very slow). 

Additional power-ups can be collected to improve the player&apos;s chances, some of the items available are: additional guns, larger fuel tanks, crystal magnets and impervious shields. Some of these add-ons are time-limited while others last until the player&apos;s current ship is destroyed. In the asteroid field, there are also &apos;popcorn&apos; asteroids; small blue rock formations that grow larger and travel faster with each hit they take until they become large, non-moving objects on the screen. These obstacles must be avoided since hitting them will drain all of the ship&apos;s fuel, costing the player a life. A popcorn asteroid can not be destroyed. Hitting anything other than bonus power-ups and energy crystals costs precious fuel. Clearing a sector of all of its asteroids takes the player back to a screen and shows a preview of all of the cleared and uncleared sectors in this star system. Some sectors are marked as &quot;unknown&quot; and no preview is offered for these levels. From here, the player can choose which system they wish to tackle next. All systems need to be cleared before the player is given the chance to battle against Mukor himself. To kill Mukor, the player must eliminate each of the volcanoes with multiple blaster hits. Destroying a volcano causes Mukor to release bonus power-up items, and destroying all of the volcanoes causes</desc>

BlaZeon (c) 1992 Atlus Company, Limited.

The player is set in control of The Garland TFF-01, a sub-standard space fighter ship that is only armed with a semi-auto or rapid fire laser gun known as the Beam Vulcan and the Tranquilander. Some enemy units can be captured and used in play; certain enemy robots, when shot by the player&apos;s Tranquilander, will morph into an outline of themselves. The player can then fly into the outline, and take on the form of the enemy robot, taking control of its weapons, abilities and special attacks.

There is also addition to the boss battle scoring: similar to some shooters, players have the opportunity to increase their scores by beating the end level bosses within a certain time limit. Every time a boss battle is initiated, a timer will count down and once the boss is destroyed/killed before the timer reaches zero, then the time left will add to the player&apos;s end-level score; if the timer runs out, then the score at the end of the level will remain unaffected.</desc>

Blazing Star (c) 1998 Yumekobo.

Blazing Star is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the planets of Remuria and Mutras are engaged in endless interplanetary war. This fuels the development of ever-more dangerous weapons, eventually leading to the production of fully organic weapons that combine both human and alien technology. Soon, a fully sentient weapon called &apos;Brawshella&apos; is born. Brawshella gathers all animal life on Remuria and Mutras and bends them to its will, forcing them to attack and assimilate the human race. 

Within days of Brawshella&apos;s appearance all humans are assimilated and now have no other purpose than to continue fighting each other. Over time, six of the assimilated fighter pilots regain their consciousness and remember their pasts. Upon rediscovering their humanity, they turn against the machines, in a battle to save humanity.

Blazing Star is controlled via joystick and two buttons. Button &apos;A&apos; fires the normal shot, if this is tapped rapidly, however, a variation on the normal shot is used. If the A button is held down, the ship stores energy for a charged shot, which is fired when the button is released. The charged-shot attacks have a duration based on how long the button is held for. Pressing the B button during the attack will split the projectile, greatly increasing its range.

Players can choose to pilot one of six different ships, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The &apos;Hellhound&apos; is the perfect ship for performing high-scoring combos, for example. The &apos;Windina&apos; has a wide and powerful shot; both &apos;Dinos&apos; - the Pulstar hunters - are excellent in defense and pack efficient weapons. Finally, Aryutalism and Peplos require a little more skill and are best suited to experienced players. 

Power-ups can increase the strength of the player&apos;s guns, while also increasing the maximum power of the charged shot. The types of shots, charge-up attacks, and split shots used are dependent on which ship the player selects.</desc>

Blood Bros. (c) 1990 TAD.

Blood Bros is an into-the-screen shooter with the action viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective. The brothers can move left and right to avoid incoming fire while the enemies themselves are targeted by moving an on-screen cross-hair over them and pressing fire. If the fire button is held down, the player-character remains static, allowing for more accurate targeting of the cross-hair. While static, the brothers are more vulnerable to incoming enemy fire.

Players have limitless ammunition for their primary gun, and carry a limited number of sticks of dynamite. Dynamite is used in a similar fashion to grenades; it can be thrown at enemies and inflicts greater damage than guns. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed. Each of the game&apos;s stages is littered with structures that can also be destroyed. This removes enemy cover as well as earning players bonus points. 

Power-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed on-screen or dropped by shooting the special characters that occasionally appear, such as the small Indian Chief or warthogs. Points and weaponry can also be dispensed from the tin can, if you shoot it into the air and juggle it with subsequent shots. Some power-ups give special weapons with increased firepower, others grant extra dynamite or points.</desc>

Blood Storm (c) 1994 Strata.

Blood Storm is considered by many as a quasi-&apos;sequel&apos; to Time Killers. The game had a rather dark storyline as there were few ambiguously good characters as the other ranged from being sociopathically insane or deceptive folk.

BloodStorm was dubbed as a possible “MK-killer” in an attempt to surpass rival Midway&apos;s success with Mortal Kombat, though it did not prevail. It was the last game Strata produced before the company went out of business.

As with its predecessor Time Killers, BloodStorm features many of the aspects carried down from it, such as the removal of an opponent’s arms and an ‘instant kill’ attack, as well as a Special Death Move. The button layout is virtually the same. They are labeled as &quot;back leg&quot;, &quot;front leg&quot;, &quot;back arm&quot; and &quot;front arm&quot; respectively. A button in the center is used to make the character block. As one would suspect, if a particular limb is lost in combat, its corresponding button is rendered useless.

BloodStorm is also a weapons-based fighter, though it differs from Time Killers in that the characters use weapons called &quot;Gauntlets&quot; that also allow them to use particular powers and attacks with them. Other than being able to bash off an opponent’s arms, a technique called a ‘Sunder’ is also in the game. If executed when an opponent is stunned, it will destroy their lower body. The character will not be able to jump or use kicks, but can still move back and forth a little with the leg buttons.

Even after a successful Sunder attack, the fight can still go on, if the character’s life bar is not totally drained yet. However, if both limbs are lost afterwards (if they weren&apos;t already torn off prior to the Sunder attack) then s/he is almost completely helpless. (There are a few special moves that don&apos;t require arms or legs, and those can still be performed). Characters are restored back to normal form after a round is over much like Time Killers as well.

A notable feature in the game is that when an opponent is defeated, the player gains a ‘passable power’ much like in a style akin to the Mega Man series. These powers or weapons can be used at any time to give the player a further advantage. Also, players can save their progress in a game with a password feature by pressing buttons during the player select screen. However, since the data was saved only until the machine was turned off, it was less than beneficial unless used to pick the game back up whe</desc>

Raguy (c) 1991 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.

Raguy is an environmentally-themed scrolling platform game for one or two players in which the peaceful home planet of Raguy has been invaded by the evil Daruma tribe. The Daruma are polluting the planet as they consume its dwindling resources and time is running out. 

Taking on the role of a heroic young man called &apos;Blue&apos; (with the second player playing &apos;Princess Fa&apos; in the two-player game), players must fight through fourteen stages, split over four different worlds, to defeat the Daruma and save the planet&apos;s eco system. 

Both Blue and Princess Fa have the ability to stun enemies by hitting them with a large leaf that serves as their default weapon. Once stunned, enemies can be picked up and thrown as projectiles at other enemies. Blue and Princess Fa can also shrink in size in order to access hidden areas, but they are not able to stun enemies while in shrunken form. If only one player is shrunk, they can be picked up by the other player and thrown as a projectile at enemies. Blue and the Princess can also jump on enemies&apos; heads and propel them at other enemies, but if the enemy ricochets and hits the player, the player takes damage.

As well as the default leaf weapon, other weapons in the form of either boomerangs or bombs can be picked up and all weapons can be powered-up three times. Other items that can aid the players&apos; quest include a plant stem that increases player Speed and additional hearts that increase player health.

Flowers are scattered throughout the stages and these are the game&apos;s currency to be used in the shops that occasionally appear. There are two different types of shop, offering either tips and advice for overcoming certain obstacles, or health, attribute and weapon power-ups.

At the end of each world players must battle a large boss character. Once the boss has been defeated, the game offers a branching path with players able to choose their next route.</desc>

Bomb Jack Twin (c) 1993 NMK.

Bomb Jack Twin is a direct sequel to the 1984 original and retains the same platform-based collect-the-bombs gameplay of its predecessor.

Changes over the original game include a slightly faster playing tempo and the option for simultaneous two-player action. As with the prequel, extra points and bonuses can be earned by collecting bonus coins and bombs with their fuses still lit. Bomb Jack Twin also retains the &apos;Powerball&apos; feature of its predecessor which, when collected, freezes the level&apos;s enemies for several seconds, allowing them to be destroyed.

The way the sequel&apos;s levels are structured differs significantly from the original game. In &quot;Bomb Jack&quot;, each screen was simply numbered sequentially and the background picture changed on every screen, but the stages in &quot;Bomb Jack Twin&quot; are grouped into &apos;rounds&apos;, each consisting of three screen layouts but retaining a single background picture for the duration of that round.

Another new addition is the bonus screen. This appears every couple of rounds and players must try to collect all bombs on the screen within a tight time limit to earn extra bonus points. There are no enemies on the bonus screens and the background is plain black.

As with the first game, &quot;Bomb Jack Twin&quot; takes place in different locations throughout the world. A map screen is displayed before the start of each new round showing the next location. The available locations are: Germany, Thailand, Nevada, Japan, England, Hong Kong and China.</desc>

Bonanza Bros. (c) 1990 Sega.

Bonanza Bros. is a strategic platform shoot-em-up with one or two players taking on the roles of Robo and Mobo, two cat-burgling brothers who must negotiate scrolling platform-based levels and steal a set number of valuable items, before making their way to the roof to escape in a waiting airship. The location of the items is highlighted on a cut-away map displayed in the middle of the screen and each stage must be completed within a set time limit.

The game&apos;s 2D platforms are displayed using forced-perspective 3D, this allows both the players and enemies to move between the front and back of the platforms. The game&apos;s enemies have a limited field of vision, making it possible for players to hide from them by ducking into alcoves, stairwells and other background scenery. Players can walk, jump and shoot and enemies can be neutralized either by being shot, or by slamming doors against them. They will only remain stunned for a few seconds, however. 

&quot;Bonanza Bros.&quot; promotes the use of stealth, with enemies alerted by sounds or by players entering their field of vision. Once alerted, enemies will either hide, call for help or fire at the players. On some stages, hazardous items litter the ground that should either be avoided or jumped over. These include discarded Coke cans, banana skins and garden rakes and if players walk into them, they will slip and fall, creating a noise and alerting nearby guards to their presence. Some guards carry a riot shield and can only be hit when they are walking away from the player. If players get shot too many times, or if they fail to steal all treasure items and reach the escape point within the time limit, the brothers end up in jail and it&apos;s game over.

The game has a total of twelve stages, with extra bonus stages appearing after every second level. These bonus rounds take place on a single screen and the aim is to collect treasure items from a number of ledges within a set time limit. Search lights constantly move around the screen and if one touches the player, the bonus round ends. Each bonus screen has alcoves that players can hide in to evade the search lights.

Each of the game&apos;s twelve stages is set in a different building. The stages are: 
* BANK
* MILLIONAIRE&apos;S MANSION
* CASINO
* MINT
* DEPARTMENT STORE
* GOLD MINE
* JEWELLERY STORE
* LABORATORY
* DELUXE LINER (YACHT)

Boot Hill (c) 1977 Midway.

A classic 1 or 2-player western gunfight game, featuring a monochrome display overlaid via mirror onto back-lit plastic background. Each player uses a small joystick to move their cowboy up and down the play area, while a second, much larger joystick is used to aim the pistol and shoot - this larger stick also has a trigger button. The game&apos;s single goal is simply to shoot the other player, who is situated on the opposite side of the game area. Wagons and cacti litter the middle of the play area, providing temporary cover from the opponent&apos;s gunfire (while, of course, providing the opponent with cover from the PLAYER&apos;S shots). These obstacles slowly disintegrate as they are shot; much like the shields in Taito&apos;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot;.

Boot Hill is time-based NOT life based, with the factory default set at ninety seconds. This is, of course, operator adjustable via the dip settings. The computer opponent is quite easy to beat with a little practice, but a human opponent provides a much stronger challenge.</desc>

Bosconian - Star Destroyer (c) 1981 Namco. 

Bosconian is a multi-directional shoot-em-up set in space, in which the player pilots a small craft called the &apos;Star Fighter&apos; and must destroy waves of green space stations that form part of a huge enemy fleet. Each station consists of six cannons arranged in a hexagon, surrounding a central core. To destroy a station, the player must either destroy all six cannons or shoot the core. The core can only be reached by precisely firing through a single, narrow channel that leads directly to it. In later rounds, the core is more heavily defended, with both a rotating shield and missiles. All enemy stations must be destroyed to progress to the next round.

Players must also avoid or destroy asteroids, mines, enemy missiles and fighter ships. The space stations will also occasionally launch squadrons of ships that attack in formation. Destroying the leader of a formation causes all remaining enemies to disperse, but destroying all enemies in a formation scores extra bonus points. 

A spy ship will often appear and if this is not destroyed quickly, the enemy alert level will change to red and the alien ships will attack the player with much greater aggression and speed. The spy ships can be identified by their yellow and green coloring.

The game&apos;s three alert levels are:
* GREEN: No enemies are within view.
* YELLOW: A small number of enemies are present.
* RED: The enemy are aware of the player and will attack aggressively and at speed.

Although there are no in-game power-ups available, the player&apos;s ship fires from both the front and rear simultaneously. A radar map to the right of the play area shows the position of the player ship relative to any remaining enemy space stations. Active enemy squadrons are also shown.</desc>

Bubble Bobble (c) 1986 Taito Corp.

One or two players take on the role of Bub and Bob, two cute dinosaurs who must battle through 100 platform-packed single screen levels to rescue their girlfriends. Bub and Bob are armed only with the ability to blow bubbles, in which the game&apos;s many enemies can be trapped and killed. The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the dinosaurs reach previously inaccessible areas of a level. 

Any trapped enemies who are not killed quickly enough will turn red and escape their bubble prison. These angry enemies are much faster than before, making them harder to kill. Enemies also become angry if players are taking too long to complete a level. Defeated enemies are turned into bonus fruit items that can be collected for points. 

On many levels, bubbles containing fire, water or a lightning bolt appear. These can be burst by players to release their contents and destroy enemies. The fire bubble drops flames down onto the nearest platform, killing any enemies it hits. The lightning bubble sends a lightning bolt horizontally across the screen, its direction dictated by whichever side of the bubble the player hits to burst it. The water bubble releases a torrent of water that will quickly flow down the platforms to the bottom of the screen. Any enemies caught in the flow are killed. 

Bubbles containing letters also appear. The aim is to collect the letters needed to spell the word E.X.T.E.N.D. which earns players an extra life. 

The game&apos;s simple-yet-involving game-play saw Bubble Bobble become an instant classic. Its two-player co-operative mode, coupled with the incredible amount of hidden secrets and potential for strategic play - unheard of in the platform genre - would set the standard by which all other platform games were judged.</desc>

Bubble Bobble II (c) 1994 Taito.

Bubble Bobble II, also known as Bubble Symphony, is the first direct sequel to Taito&apos;s 1986 platform classic, &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; (&apos;Rainbow Islands&quot; was the first official sequel, but played very differently), in which one or two players take on the role of the famous bubble-blowing dinosaurs who must once again fight their way through a large number of single-screen platform-based levels, trapping monsters with their bubbles before bursting them to destroy the trapped enemies. 

While the game plays identically to its predecessor, several new changes and additions have been made to breathe new life into the classic gameplay. As well as new bonuses, weapons, enemies and characters, players can now create &apos;Multiple Bubbles&apos;; if the player holds the button down for a few seconds before releasing, up to three bubbles are produced at once. 

Other gameplay changes include Boss encounters that occur every five to ten levels. These boss screens are part of a new &apos;branching level&apos; structure; once a boss is defeated, players chose to enter one of two doors to determine what level set they tackle next. 

In addition to Bubble Bobble&apos;s original heroes, Bub and Bob, two new selectable female characters have been added, called Kululun and Cororon. Each of the four dinosaurs possess different gameplay attributes, which are as follows: 
* Bubblun - Average 
* Bobblun - Faster speed 
* Kululun - Bubbles float the furthest 
* Cororon - Bubbles float the fastest 

The game&apos;s graphics are, inevitably, a vast improvement over the original game, with lush, colourfully rendered backgrounds and detailed, smoothly animated sprites doing full justice to Bubble Bobble&apos;s legendary characters. The game also features cameo appearances by a number of characters from many other Taito classics. 

The game features multiple endings.</desc>

Bubble Memories - The Story of Bubble Bobble III (c) 1996 Taito.

One day in the land of the Rainbow Island, twin brothers Bubby and Bobby are playing together in the shadow of the tower that watches over and protects their homeland when suddenly, they are transformed into bubble-blowing dragons by the evil Super Dark Great Dragon. The Great Dragon then takes possession of the tower and destroys the &apos;Magical Rainbow Potion&apos; from which the tower draws its strength, causing it to separate into seven differently-coloured potions. 

The twins must climb the 80 floors of the tower to free it from his clutches and regain their human forms. The final ten levels of the tower can only be accessed by collecting 7 differently-coloured potions to reform the Magical Rainbow Potion. 

The fourth and final arcade outing for Bub and Bob (not counting the &quot;Puzzle Bobble/Bust-a-Move&quot; series), &quot;Bubble Memories&quot; returns once more to the classic, single-screen gameplay of the series&apos; legendary first outing. Graphically, the game is very similar to &quot;Bubble Symphony&quot;, released two years earlier, with the only real visual difference being the latter game&apos;s use of digitized animal and plant photographs to form the game&apos;s backdrops.

One major new gameplay addition is the introduction of &apos;Super Bubbles&apos;. There are now two sizes of bubbles - standard and large; players can now hold down the bubble button until their characters glow, then release it to produce a giant bubble. This bubble can trap either a single large enemy (another new addition to the game), or several standard enemies. This replaces the &apos;Multiple Bubble&apos; ability of the previous game in the series.

Bubby and Bobby are young boys in the intro, indicating that this is a prequel to the series.</desc>

Bubbles (c) 1982 Williams.

In Bubbles you control a cartoon soap bubble inside a large sink. The object of the game is clean out the sink. You can safely scrub away ants, grease, and crumbs all the time. But sponges, roaches, brushes, and razor blades are deadly to a small bubble. Don&apos;t worry too much though, because your bubble grows in size as it swallows up the dirt in the sink. When it gets big enough it will be able to hit brushes and sponges (but still not razors).</desc>

In the first two sections the player controls Hiromi on the airbike, which can move to the left and right, as well as braking and accelerating. The airbike can also fire bullets and missiles at the enemies. The third area of every world is a boss area. The airbike will be transformed into a flying ship which can move in all directions. The fourth area of each world is a bonus stage and the player has to collect as many spheres as possible for bonus points.</desc>

Cabal (c) 1988 TAD Corporation.

Cabal is a war themed shoot-em-up with one or simultaneous two-player gameplay in which two unnamed commandos must battle through five different stages - each containing four screens of play - to reach and defeat an evil dictator.

The game is an into-the-screen shooter with the action viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective. The commandos can move left and right to avoid incoming fire while the enemies themselves are targeted by moving an on-screen cross-hair over them and pressing fire. If the fire button is held down, the commando remains static, allowing for more accurate targeting of the cross-hair. While static, the commandos are vulnerable to incoming enemy fire.

Initially, the commandos are armed with only a standard single-shot gun (albeit with unlimited-ammunition) and a limited number of grenades, but additional grenades and weapon power-ups can be earned as play progresses.

As well as enemy troops, vehicles such as tanks, armoured cars and helicopters also appear and take numerous shots to destroy. When destroyed or killed, some on-screen targets release points bonuses and weapon power-ups that drop to the bottom of the screen and can be picked up by the commandos. Weapon power-ups include additional grenades, a rapid-fire machine and an automatic shotgun, which has a slightly lower firing rate but has a larger targeting cross-hair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot.

Each of the game&apos;s screens is littered with buildings and barricades that can also be destroyed. This removes enemy cover as well as earning players bonus points.</desc>

Cameltry (c) 1990 Taito Corp.

The player must guide a ball through a number of mazes, rotating the maze through 180 degrees to get the ball to move in the desired direction - much like the special stages in the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive title, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Each maze must be completed within a tight time limit, and a number of traps and obstacles litter the mazes to slow players down.

There are, however, a number of positive targets to be hit, and bonuses - such as additional time - can be found hidden away within the mazes. When the ball is stuck or the player would like to speed up, the JUMP button can be used. If the player runs out of time before reaching the goal, a random matching game is run to allow the player more time to complete the maze. This challenge, however, is very difficult to win.</desc>

Caveman Ninja (c) 1991 Data East Corporation.

Caveman Ninja is a horizontally-scrolling platform beat-em-up set in prehistoric times with one or two players taking on the roles of cavemen Joe and Mac. Rival caveman have invaded Joe and Mac&apos;s village and kidnapped all of their women and it&apos;s up to the two heroes to venture forth and save them. 

Joe and Mac must battle through numerous prehistorically-themed stages, fighting enemy cavemen and marauding dinosaurs. The heroes are initially armed with throwing axes that can be tossed either vertically or horizontally, travelling in a short arc. By holding down the attack button, larger, more powerful weapons will be thrown. When close to an enemy, Joe and Mac will utilise a wooden club to whack them. Players can also jump much higher by holding UP and JUMP.

Joe and Mac each have a life meter that gradually depletes over time, with additional energy losses incurred when players are hit by a enemies or projectile. Food can be collected from defeated enemies to top up the players&apos; energy levels. Different weapons can be found throughout the stages including stone wheels, fireballs, and shadowy doppelgangers that charge forward and attack enemies. Other power-ups include hot sauce or jalapeno peppers that give players temporary invincibility and fiery breath. 

Certain enemy strikes - such as being hit by a thrown boulder - will flatten Joe and Mac like pancakes for a few seconds, although they can still move and attack while in this form, albeit more slowly. During the simultaneous two-player game, both characters are capable of damaging each other. The game allows players to select between different routes after each boss battle. Also, after defeating the final boss, the players can choose between three exits, each one leading to a slightly different ending sequence.</desc>

Chack&apos;n Pop (c) 1984 Taito.

Chack&apos;n Pop is considered by many to be the precursor to the venerable game Bubble Bobble. The cast consists of two enemies that would later be seen in Bubble Bobble. Many fans of the Bubble Bobble series may find Chack&apos;n Pop less fun to play due to its high degree of difficulty.

The game puts the player in the role of Mr. Chack&apos;n, who must rescue all of the hearts that were stolen during a romantic interlude between him and Miss Chack&apos;n. Chack&apos;n is an interesting character with equally interesting abilities. He can toss two bombs, only one in each direction at a time. He can also effortlessly go from walking on the floor to walking on the ceiling. If the ceiling is low enough, Chack&apos;n can extend his legs until his head touches the ceiling to immediately begin walking on it.

Chack&apos;n must use his bombs to release the captured hearts from their cages. Once all of the hearts are freed, he can escape through the top right corner of the maze. Along the way, purple Monstas will be trying to stop Chack&apos;n simply by colliding with him. Chack&apos;n can use his bombs to defeat the Monstas, but the limited use he has over them makes the bombs an unreliable attack method. Once Chack&apos;n spends enough time in a maze, it is not uncommon for him to become completely overwhelmed by the presence of the Monstas.</desc>

Changes (c) 1982 Orca.

This maze game is quite similar to &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. The player controls a caterpillar that crawls along the branches of a maze-like tree eating nuts and strawberries while avoiding deadly bugs and a hungry bird. The caterpillar changes into a butterfly after everything has been eaten.

The caterpillar must eat all the strawberries and nuts on each level to become a butterfly. Eating a strawberry temporarily makes the caterpillar invincible allowing it to kill the deadly bugs and score 400 bonus points ber bug. If the caterpillar remains still for too long, an invincible owl (replaced by an invincible bat in later levels) will appear. If your catepillar moves, the owl or bat will disappear.  If your catepillar remains still, the invincible owl or bat will chase the caterpillar, albiet not very effrctively.  

When the caterpillar crosses over a pivot branch, all the branches will rotate at once, and any bugs that are on those branches will fall off and score 400, 800, 1600 and 3200 points, depending on the amount of bugs killed. Keep an eye out for the flowers that will appear below the house - they will reward you between 400 and 3200 points, depending on the level.</desc>

Bonuses can be picked up to increase the firepower, and barrels can either be smashed to reveal bonuses, or picked up and thrown at the enemies. In addition; the Ninja can perform high jump by pressing the JUMP button, then pressing it again while the Ninja is in the air. This is useful for avoiding enemies and essential for reaching high platforms.</desc>

Chimera Beast (c) 1993 Jaleco.

A horizontally scrolling shoot&apos;em up where 1 or 2 players control creatures known as &apos;eaters&apos; which are capable of eating other creatures and taking their DNA, thus acquiring their abilities or characteristics.

Chimera Beast takes place on a planet which is described as distant and Earth-like. The planet is overrun by animals known as eaters, capable of eating other creatures and acquiring their abilities or characteristics. The player controls one of these eaters and progresses through the game by means of evolution, consuming microscopic organisms in the first stage, fish in the second, and so on. When the player&apos;s creature gets big enough to take on humanity, the goal of the game is revealed. The planet&apos;s humans have developed space travel, which the player must thwart, so as not to give the eaters a means of escaping the planet. There are two possible endings: one in which the player is able to stop the eaters from escaping the planet, and one in which the eaters do escape and, we are told, will eventually make their way to Earth.

The chief innovation of Chimera Beast is its power-up system. Instead of collecting gun upgrades as in most games of this genre, the player&apos;s eater enhances itself by eating other creatures and assuming their abilities and defenses. Instead of simply having various types of projectile weaponry, the game attempts to make these new abilities as varied as possible. Consuming a crustacean might give the player&apos;s eater a hard protective shell, for example, while an insectoid creature might offer a poisonous tail instead. The game even includes the ability to use cancer as a weapon.

Another difference from typical shooter mechanics is that the player&apos;s eater does not die after being hit. It has a life bar, which can be charged by consuming enemies. It is even possible to eat enough charge the life bar past its starting position, creating a larger eater which is not only more powerful but can take more damage as well.</desc>

The Cliffhanger - Edward Randy (c) 1990 Data East.

A fast moving platform game in which the player controls the Indiana Jones-esque and unfortunately named &apos;Edward Randy&apos;. The levels are an inventive mix of standard platform action and 3-D scrolling levels; the latter usually having the player driving a jeep and repelling the enemy attacks. The game is based on the archetypal Hollywood action blockbuster and features a filmic score to back up the on-screen action. The player&apos;s only weapon is a whip - another nod to the Indiana Jones character - which can be used to both attack enemies and as a &apos;rope&apos;, to enable the player to reach distant platforms.</desc>

魂斗羅 (c) 1987 Konami.
(Contra)

In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien being. Two years later, a terrorist organization calling themselves Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

&apos;Contra&apos; is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 10 stages. In addition to the standard side-view levels, there are also &quot;3D maze&quot; stages in which the player must proceed through a series of corridors inside an enemy base, destroying various sensors, in order to reach the core of the base.

Each player&apos;s character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character&apos;s movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player&apos;s character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player&apos;s inventory.

As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are:
Machine Gun: Auto-fire.
Spread gun [S]: Allows the player to fire 5 shots in an arc.
Laser: Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.
Fire Ball [F]: A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.
Rapid Bullets [R]: Increases the firing rate of the player&apos;s currently equipped weapon. Works with the Machine Gun and Fire Ball.
Barrier [B]: Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.

The game consists of ten stages:
Stage 01: Jungle (horizontal scroll)
Stage 02: Inside Base 1 (3D maze)
Stage 03: Core of Base 1 (3D fixed)
Stage 04: Waterfall (vertical scroll)
Stage 05: Inside Base 2 (3D maze)
Stage 06: Core of Base 2 (3D fixed)
Stage 07: Snow Field (horizontal scroll)
Stage 08: Energy Zone (horizontal scroll)
Stage 09: Hangar (horizontal scroll)
Stage 10: Alien Lair (horizontal scroll)</desc>

Cotton Boomerang - Magical Night Dreams (c) 1998 Success.

A followup game to Cotton 2, Cotton Boomerang uses the same graphics, sound and enemies, but slightly different gameplay.
Gone are the lifebars, now you have one-hit kills (similar to the very first episode).
Gone are the extra lives, instead you have 3 chosen characters, tag-team style.
Gone is the experience-based level system, leveling up now depends on bonus items during the game.
Gone are the special, full-screen Magic attacks, instead you have an instant smart-bomb when you change into a different character in-game.
Gone are the powerup-dependant magic attacks, now each character has his/her own magic attack by default.
The characters are also equipped with secondary attacks to make their shooting style more distinctive from each other. And to top that, you have plenty of new moves, counterattacks, powerups, and key combinations to use.

Whereas Cotton 2 was more of a tactical shooter (whenever that is applicable to the game) with its chain combo and life/experience system, Cotton Boomerang is an all-out shooter due to the added moves, different level layout, and generally faster and crazier gameplay.</desc>

Crime City (c) 1989 Taito Corporation.

Crime City is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up for one or two players in which two cops by the names of Tony Gibson and Raymond Brody are tasked with taking down the gangs of criminals that have overrun their city. 

Each of the game&apos;s six stages focuses on a specific criminal activity, such as bank robbery or smuggling. The goal of each stage is to reach the powerful &apos;boss&apos; character then defeat and arrest them.

The game&apos;s heroes start each stage armed only with a pistol, but extra weapons become available as players progress through the stage. Both the pistol and additional weapons - which include a machine-gun, an armour-piercing gun and a threeway gun - have only a limited amount of ammunition and if players run out of ammo, they will only be able to punch or &apos;somersault attack&apos; the attacking enemies. 

Each stage features background objects that can be used against the enemies, such as wooden barrels, boxes and hanging lights. When shot, some criminals drop packets of illegal drugs, which can be picked up for bonus points.

The game&apos;s lead characters of Tony Gibson and Raymond Brody were also the lead characters in Taito&apos;s 1988 crime-themed racing game, Chase HQ. Crime City&apos;s gameplay takes its inspiration from Namco&apos;s Rolling Thunder.

The game&apos;s final three stages focus on the kidnapping of the city&apos;s mayor, ending with a final confrontation with the city&apos;s kingpin of crime himself. The six stages are:
* Prison Break
* Bank Robbery
* Smuggling
* Kidnapping (Round 1)
* Kidnapping (Round 2)
* Kidnapping (Round 3)</desc>

Export release. 4-Player Conversion Kit. Game developed in Japan. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese release entry; &quot;Crime Fighters [Model GX821]&quot;.

- TRIVIA -

In this version:
* Reverse kick removed. This is now a 2-button game (punch &amp; kick) instead of 3 in the original version.
* Character&apos;s energy is represented by a numerical hit point value which is always on countdown to zero. Additional hit points may be added by inserting more coins into each player&apos;s corresponding coin slot.
* Characters can use a reversal kick which is automatically activated if an opponent is behind you as you press the kick button. This kick knocks down enemies (except bosses) with a single hit!
* The gun has limited ammo, however it is possible to pick it up again if an enemy knocks it off your hand. Also each gunshot is as strong as 3 punches or kicks and knocks down most enemies in one shot.
* You can play the extra stage (enemy boss revenge) more than once.
* Original Timer and Credit Counter removed.

Crystal Castles (c) 1983 Atari.

Crystal Castles is an inventive variation on the maze-driven collect-the-dots gameplay first seen in Namco&apos;s legendary &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. The player takes on the role of &apos;Bentley Bear&apos;, who must run around a number of &quot;castles&quot; - each presented in the form of an isometric forced 3D maze - picking up the gemstones that litter its walkways and platforms, before moving onto the next castle. 

Each level is populated by a variety of enemies, including sentient trees, gem eaters, a swarm of bees and Berthilda the Witch. Some enemy types move around the levels randomly, while others will actively chase Bentley. Gem Eaters will devour any gems they reach before the player. 

In addition to four-directional walking, Bentley can also jump to avoid pursuing enemies and obstacles. Many levels have platforms that can only be reached via an elevator and some screens also contain hidden secret passages and ramps, as well as &apos;warps&apos; that move players forward several levels. 

Jumping over the trees will shrink and temporarily disable them, while wearing Berthilda&apos;s red hat grants the player temporary invincibility, allowing them to kill the witch should they manage to catch her. If Bentley Bear touches a Gem Eater while it&apos;s in the process of eating a gem, the Gem Eater dies and 500 points are awarded to the player. However, if the Gem Eater is not eating a gem when touched, Bentley Bear dies. 

Some levels contain a large pot of honey. A swarm of bees appears near the honey approximately every five seconds but collecting the honey pot earns the player 1,000 bonus points and causes the bees to appear less frequently. Other enemies, such as the balls, skeletons and ghosts must be avoided. 

If Bentley collects all of the gems on a castle, the player receives bonus points. A bonus is also awarded in the event of the player picking up the last gem on the level. 

Crystal Castles consists of ten different stages broken down into 37 castle mazes (with four castles making up each stage, apart from 10th, which has only one castle).</desc>

Cyber-Lip is a platform shoot-em-up for one or two players that borrows heavily from Konami&apos;s &quot;Contra&quot; series. Players must battle through sideways-scrolling levels, to defeat armies of cyborgs and androids and restore order and peace to the world.

Cyber-Lip has two shooting modes, one for standard weapon use and one for rocket launchers and grenade throwing. Players can switch between the two modes at any time, but only carry a limited amount of grenades or rockets. Weapon power-ups and additional grenades and rockets can be picked up throughout the levels.

At the end of certain levels, the game&apos;s heroes will enter an elevator and players can then choose whether to go &apos;up&apos; or &apos;down&apos;, depending on which route through the game they wish to take. Each level has a large end-of-level boss that must be defeated.</desc>

Darius (c) 1987 Taito Corp.

A horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up that was unique at the time for featuring a game screen that was three times wider than the conventional size, with the arcade cabinet utilizing three CRT screens to accommodate it.

In the game, the player flies an ornate fighter craft called a Silver Hawk. The craft is equipped with two attack weapons: Missile (forward-firing standard gun) and Bomb (drops from the bottom of the ship). The Silver Hawk is also equipped with the &apos;Arm&apos; (armor); a green energy shield that can absorb enemy attacks without harm to the ship.

During the course of the levels the player must navigate the terrain and battle a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles. At the end of every level, players are greeted with the obligatory end-of-level boss. The bosses in Darius are often in the form of mechanical aquatic animals, such as fish or squid. If the player defeats the boss, the tunnel splits into two and the player must decide whether to take the upper or lower tunnel, both of which lead to a different stage. This allows many different paths to be taken through the game.

Power-ups can be obtained by shooting enemies of a certain color, with the power-ups appearing in the form of colored bubbles. Each color corresponds to one of the ship&apos;s three weapons:
* Red - Missile
* Green - Bomb
* Blue - Arm

If the player powers up a weapon more than seven times, the weapon changes to a new, more powerful version. This then becomes the player&apos;s default weapon, and can be powered up further. There are also two other colors of power-up bubble, white and orange; which can be obtained by shooting at certain sections of the terrain; unfortunately, there are no visual clues as to where these may be on any given level. These hidden power-ups offer the following:
* White - Gives a score bonus.
* Orange - Smart bomb that kills all on-screen enemies.</desc>

Darius Gaiden - Silver Hawk (c) 1994 Taito Corporation.

In this game, the third in the Darius series, the player flies an ornate fighter craft called the Silver Hawk. The craft is equipped with two weapons: Missile (forward-firing standard gun) and Bomb (drops from the bottom of the ship). The Silver Hawk is also equipped with the &apos;Arm&apos; (armor), a green energy shield that can absorb enemy attacks without harm to the ship. Some enemies leave panels behind that can be collected to power-up your shots, missiles or shield.

The graphics and sound are superior to those of the previous Darius games, and the game employs a lot of impressive visual effects; for example, the Silver Hawk warps into a stage dramatically in the fourth-tier stages, and begins to burn on re-entry at the start of the sixth-tier stages.

The bosses are huge and far more complex than those of the previous games, each employing several attack patterns and explode with powerful warping and twisting effects upon their defeat.</desc>

The Deep (c) 1987 Woodplace.

You control one or two boats floating along the high seas. The boats are armed with depth charges for dropping on the aquatic wildlife and submarines in the depth far below. Homing torpedoes, Polaris missiles, mines, Stingray style vessels and other boat-wrecking hazards make up the threats to avoid or destroy. Bonus capsules which float up to the surface boost the boat&apos;s speed, increase depth charge power, give the player temporary invincibility and other normal features but of a marine vein. The depth charges take their time to float to their target so plan ahead using the map, submarines at different heights in the water pose further problems. This game also has good backgrounds.</desc>

Die Hard Arcade (c) 1996 Sega.

A 3-D, side-scrolling beat them up for 1 or 2 players in which the president&apos;s daughter has been kidnapped by a terrorist organisation. Die Hard Arcade is based on the Bruce Willis movie of the same name, although the game&apos;s storyline is very different from that of the film&apos;s.

Players take on the role of two SWAT team members who must fight their way through a terrorist-filled sky scraper to eventually reach and defeat the head of the terrorist organisation and rescue the President&apos;s daughter. Players must clear each area of all terrorists before they can progress to the next. The terrorists can be defeated by punching and kicking them until their health bars are depleted. In addition to hand-to-hand combat, players can also utilise various weapons and objects, including handguns, machine guns, missile launchers, anti-tank cannons, knives, sticks, fireaxes, spray cans, pepper shakers, steel pipes, brooms, bottles and, at one point, a grandfather clock.

Ammunition magazines can be picked up to replace depleted ammo in hand guns and machine guns, and health units can also be found to heal any damage players have suffered. At various points in the game, a pre-set sequence will start in which players must either press the PUNCH, KICK or JUMP button, or move the joystick in a specific direction in order to successfully negotiate certain enemies or obstacles. If either of the SWAT members fail on any sequences where they are supposed to punch or kick down enemies, they will have to fight them in hand-to-hand combat. Enemies can also be grabbed, allowing players to either punch or arrest them. The latter can only be achieved if the SWAT member is holding a gun, and is achieved by pressing either the PUNCH or KICK button twice.

When the SWAT members finally confront the crime boss, they will have to face him twice; first in the office and then on the rooftop. On the rooftop, he will be armed with swords and more difficult to hurt. After the boss is defeated for the second time, The President&apos;s daughter is rescued.

From here-on the game takes a nod from Technos&apos; legendary 1987 beat-em-up, &quot;Double Dragon&quot;. If only one player completes the game, the girl simply says &apos;Thank You!&apos; and the game ends. But if 2 players complete the game, the girl will announce that she wants one of the SWAT members to become her new bodyguard. The two players will then have to fight each other until one of them i</desc>

Diet Go Go (c) 1992 Data East Corp.

Diet Go Go is a single-screen platform game for one or two players, in which the aim is to clear each screen of monsters and avoid getting fat. Monsters are defeated by throwing food at them until they inflate (get fat), then touching them to burst them, sending them flying around the screen and killing any other monsters they come into contact with. Many monsters also throw food at the players, making them increasingly fat. If players get too fat, they lose a life, although bonus diet sodas occasionally appear and can be picked up to reverse the effect. Contact with monsters who aren&apos;t fully inflated is fatal. 

When monsters are destroyed, they leave behind rings, gems, power-ups and diet tonic. Power-ups include roller-skates to move faster, compressed air to blow monsters up and increased fire power. Data East coins also appear on each level. If players collect these coins, they shoot up to the top of the screen where a fruit machine display rolls over and dispenses gems, power-ups and rings. If the fruit machine reads 777, a bonus round appears in which players jump on clouds to collect falling gems while avoiding the falling food that will make them fat.

The game starts with one player selecting an area on a world map, then progresses through two levels of play to reach a giant boss on the third round. After the boss is destroyed that world is complete and play moves onto the next. Each world has a different theme and boss.</desc>

Doki Doki Penguin Land (c) 1985 Sega.

Doki Doki Penguin Land is a platform puzzle game in which the player controls a penguin called Adelie and must safely guide an egg - by digging downwards - from the roof at the top of each stage down to the penguin&apos;s living room and waiting wife.

The penguin can push the egg left or right and can jump on it to make sure it doesn&apos;t get stuck against a wall. Digging affects the tile one block away from the penguin&apos;s position, making it impossible to dig directly downwards. If the egg gets into a position where it cannot be moved left or right, jumping and landing on it will cause it to smash. 

The game focuses on the egg rather than the main character and the screen only scrolls as far as the egg falls. Should the penguin get too far ahead, he reappears at the top of the screen. If the egg falls too far (indicated by a line three stories below it), it breaks.

Enemy polar bears patrol the stages with the aim of stopping Adelie and if the penguin leaves his egg too far behind, moles come digging out of the brickwork and try to snatch it. The moles will run away at the penguin&apos;s approach but the polar bears will attack and must be taken out by dropping rocks onto them or digging holes for them to fall into.

Each time an egg is broken, either by contact with an enemy or by falling too far, a player life is lost. The game ends once all lives have been lost.</desc>

An excellent vertically scrolling shoot&apos;em up. The player assumes the role of a pilot who is sent by their squadron to fight their former allies until one side destroys the other, all of which is a part of a mission to strengthen the military power that controls each side. The player flies their selected fighter over 5 areas of various terrain, encountering a number of land, sea and air enemies. The player&apos;s ship has two modes of fire: by tapping the fire button, shots are fired; holding it down produces a concentrated vertical beam, but also reduces the ship&apos;s speed.

The player can choose one of 3 aircraft at the start of the game, or upon continuing:
Type A: A red (or yellow/orange, for player two) fighter, which fires a narrow stream of shots
Type B: A green (or purple, for player two) helicopter, which fires its main guns forward, but has side guns that rotate in the direction of movement
Type C: A blue (or black, for player two) fighter, which fires a wide, three-way spread of shots</desc>

Double Dragon (c) 1987 Technos Japan Corp.

Double Dragon is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players, featuring twin brothers and martial arts masters, &quot;Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee&quot;. The brothers must defeat the savage street gang known as the &apos;Black Warriors&apos; to rescue Billy&apos;s kidnapped girlfriend, Marian. Standing between the brothers and Marian are four huge, colorful and varied levels; each populated with a wide variety of thugs.

Many of the game&apos;s enemies carry weapons (knives, baseball bats etc.) and should Billy or Jimmy manage to knock the weapons from the enemies&apos; hands, the heroes can pick the weapons up and use them against the enemies.

The Black Warriors is made up of six distinct enemy characters- plus Willy, the game&apos;s final boss - with each differing in both physical appearance and fighting style. The members of the Black Warriors consist of the following fighters: 
* Williams - A street punk in a tank top. In addition to the standard punches and jump kicks, his signature technique is a body blow to the stomach. He also wields weapons such as baseball bats, knives and dynamite sticks.
* Rowper - A punk who wears matching-colored pants and shirtless vest. He wields all the same weapons as Williams, but can also lift and throw heavy objects such as oildrums, boxes and stones.
* Linda - Female punk who usually carries a whip. She&apos;s not very strong, as she falls down to ground with a couple of punches or a single kick (because of this, she is the only regular-sized enemy who cannot be placed on a headlock).
* Abobo - A tall, big-muscled bald guy. His attacks includes punches, a standing kick and a body toss. He can also lift and throw heavy objects like Rowper. Due to his large size, he cannot be put into a headlock.
* Boss 1 - The first boss, a head-swap of Abobo with a Mr. T-style mohawk and beard. Fights just like Abobo, only with an added double-handed slap. Unlike Abobo, he does not use weapons. A green version of him appears as the Mission 3 boss.
* Boss 2 - The second boss. A head swap of the player who uses almost all the same techniques. 
* Willy - The game&apos;s final boss, armed, somewhat unfairly, with a machine-gun.

Double Dragon was a huge success due to the many game-play innovations it brought to the genre (see TRIVIA for details), but it demonstrates its final moment of inspired genius at the very end of the game. Should both players still be alive after the final boss has been defeated</desc>

Double Dragon II - The Revenge (c) 1988 Technos Japan Corp.

Following his defeat at the end of the original Double Dragon, Willy, the leader of the Black Warriors, retaliates against Billy and Jimmy Lee by murdering their friend, Marian, leaving the brothers with the task to avenge her death.

The sequel to Double Dragon is essentially an upgraded version of the original game, but with with a two-way attacking system similar to one previously used in Technos Japan&apos;s 1986 arcade game &quot;Renegade&quot;. Many of the attacks and combos from the original &quot;Double Dragon&quot; are retained, as well as new techniques including the invincible Cyclone Kick.

The stages and weapons are redesigned versions of items previously featured in the original game. There are a few new traps such as a bulldozer in the middle of Mission 3 and all of the transition sequences between stages are now done with the character entering the next level via a lift, making it impossible to carry one weapon to the next area.

Most of the enemy characters return from the original Double Dragon, with some given facelifts, but the stage bosses are all new. The enemies are as followed:
* Williams - Has a wilder face and longer hair. He can now run towards the player and do cartwheels. He throws his knives in mid-air and sometimes carry a shovel which he throws towards the player.
* Rowper - Has a beard and eye-patch, but otherwise is more or less identical to his original self. He carries shovels and can sometime pick up large objects.
* Linda - She now has a mohawk and face paint. She can also jump off platforms and do the elbow strike against the player. In addition to the ball and chain, she also carries grenades and knives.
* Oharra - A strongman with a clean-shaved face. Replaces Abobo from the first game and has the same attacks.
* Bolo - A head-swap of Oharra with long hair and beard. Replaces the mohawked head-swap of Abobo from the first game.
* Jeff - Same as his original self, but now carries grenades.
* Burnov - The boss of Mission 1. An obese wrestler whose face is concealed with a mask. He grabs the player and throws similar punches in the face. After dying, he will stand up and yell, disappearing in front of the player and leaving only his clothes. In later encounters, he will revive himself at least once.
* Abore - The boss of Mission 2. A huge suspender-wearing strongman with Terminator-like sunglasses. His slaps and shoulder tackles do massive d</desc>

Dragon Breed (c) 1989 Irem Corp.

Dragon Breed is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player controls the game&apos;s hero, Kayus, who is riding on the back of a fully articulated dragon named &apos;Bahamoot&apos;. The dragon is immune to enemy attacks, capable of blocking most projectiles and of damaging and eventually killing enemies on contact. Dragon rider Kayus is armed with a forward-firing crossbow but unlike his steed, is not invulnerable and will be killed by contact with either enemies or their projectiles. 

What separates Dragon Breed from other games in the genre is in how the Dragon can be utilised. Bahamoot&apos;s body is flexible and responds to Kayus&apos; movement, enabling Kayus to use Bahamoot as both a mobile shield and a whip-like weapon. It&apos;s also possible to encircle the tail around a group of enemies to kill them. The tail of the yellow or blue dragon can be coiled around the dragon&apos;s rider to offer almost complete invulnerability for a limited time.

Bahamoot can also spit fireballs. By holding the fire button down, the dragon will build up fire in its mouth; the longer the button is held down, the more powerful the fireball will be. There are four levels of fireball power and at its strongest, the fireball resembles a dragon&apos;s head.

Power-ups appear in the form of orbs, acquired by shooting small green dragons that appear intermittently throughout stages. There are four different types of orbs, each of will change Bahamoot to a different colour and grant him a new attack power: 
* Red orb enables the dragon to breathe a flame. 
* Gold orb enables Bahamoot&apos;s body to fire crescents in all directions. 
* Silver orb enables the dragon to produce up to four miniature dragons, which home in on enemies. 
* Blue orb enables Bahamoot to fire bolts of electricity downwards from its underside. 

The player can enhance a specific power by picking up the same type of orb, this can be done up to three times. 

Dragon Breed also includes platforming elements. At certain points during a stage horizontal platforms appear, these often have power-ups on them and the dragon rider can dismount and run along the platforms while the dragon waits above.</desc>

Dyna Gear - An Action Adventure On The Era Of Dinosaur (c) 1993 Sammy.

Dyna Gear is a scrolling platform run &apos;n&apos; gun game for one or two players in which two starships from the year 2993 AD fall through a time-hole and end up 65 million years in the past, above a prehistoric Earth-like planet. One ship is piloted by hero and &apos;time patroller&apos;, Roger, while the other is piloted by the evil Gustaf. The two ships shoot each down and crash-land onto the planet below, where Roger discovers that Gustaf has transformed many of the planet&apos;s dinosaurs into aggressive &apos;combat dinosaurs&apos;. 

Players take control of either the muscular hero, Roger, or of Wolf; a bipedal wolfman who wants to free his prehistoric homeworld from Gustaf&apos;s clutches. They must battle through several dinosaur-infested stages in their quest to end Gustaf&apos;s plans. 

Different weapons and health boosts can be found in the destructible wooden chests that litter the stages, enemies also drop coins when killed that can be collected for bonus points. 

Each of the two heroes also has a &apos;double-jump&apos; move; players can jump, then jump again while still in the air. This allows them to reach previously inaccessible ledges and platforms as well as occasionally take different routes through a stage. In the single-player game, a wolfman will occasionally join with the player to aid in the fight. A large, powerful &apos;boss&apos; dinosaur guards the end of each stage and must be defeated to progress.</desc>

Elevator Action Returns (c) 1995 Taito.

Elevator Action Returns is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up for one or two players who each take on the role of a special task force operative and must foil a terrorist group that has planted nuclear bombs in various facilities. Players must also obtain the secret intelligence data scattered throughout each facility in order to disarm the bombs. 

The objective of the game is to enter all of the red-coloured doors in each stage, then proceed to the exit. If players miss one of the red doors, they will be unable to progress beyond a certain point. There are also blue-coloured doors and entering these will award the player a special item, these include health refills, special firearms, sub-weapons and bonus points.

The player&apos;s default weapon is a semi-automatic handgun with unlimited ammunition but more powerful weapons - either a missile launcher or machine gun - can be found. These have limited ammunition, however and if the ammo for either weapon runs out, players will revert to their default weapon. Extra ammunition for these weapons can occasionally be found, however. 

It&apos;s possible to conserve ammo by attacking an enemy at close range, triggering a melee attack rather than firing a weapon. When an enemy is defeated with a close-range attack, the amount of points awarded is doubled. Players can also attack the enemy with a jumping attack or can throw an explosive (which serves as the character&apos;s sub-weapon). Explosives are thrown by pressing the SHOOT and JUMP buttons simultaneously while standing or crouching and the type of explosive used depends on which character the player is using. 

Objects within the environment can also be used to fight enemies. Elevators can be used to crush enemies standing above or below one. There are also oil drums that can be exploded with gunfire, they will then leave a trail of fire that will burn any enemies that come into contact with it. During the latter half of the game, players will also have to deal with electric barriers that will harm both players and enemies alike.

Each player character has a health gauge that shows the amount of damage they have sustained and when the gauge reaches zero, the player will lose a life. Players can choose to play as one of three different characters:

* Kart Bradfield - The fastest and most agile of the group. His default gun is a Glock 18, which he can upgrade to either an AK-47 assault rifle or</desc>

Exed Exes (c) 1985 Capcom Company, Limited.

Exed Exes is an arcade vertical shooter developed by Capcom. It was licensed to Memetron and released outside of Japan in the arcades as Savage Bees Memetron (licensor to the game). It uses similar hardware to Capcom&apos;s 1942, but it is more of a spiritual successor to Capcom&apos;s earlier shooter Vulgus. It takes place in a science fiction alien hive where you must pilot your ship through many stages protected by insects, some as large as your craft, and some even larger.

What made Exed Exes stand apart from other shooters, besides the high resolution graphics for its time, and the detailed use of parallax scrolling to indicate depth, was the fact that it was one of the earliest vertical shooters to allow for two player simultaneous play. Rather than waiting for one player to take his turn, two players could enjoy the game at the same time, and even work cooperatively to get further along in the game.</desc>

Express Raider (c) 1986 Data East Corp.

The wild west-themed Express Raider is separated into two different game types; a sideways scrolling fighting sequence and a shooting sequence. The player controls a train robber, or &apos;Express Raider&apos;, and must try to steal the bags of money from the moving locomotives.

During the fighting sequence, the Raider must fight the bank teller, hit the coyotes and then jump onto the train before it speeds away. Once on the train, he must fight his way past other enemies and avoid various projectiles, such as bottles, bullets and shovels full of coal. Players must be careful to duck under the low signs that come along as the train is travelling. Also, once a train carriage is clear of enemies, a bomb will appear between the current carriage and the next; players must quickly jump over to the next carriage before the bomb goes off, otherwise the Raider will fall from the train and a life is lost. If the Express Raider manages to reach the train engine, the loot will be captured and the game will then move on to the shooting sequence.

In the shooting sequence, the Express Raider rides a horse and must shoot at the enemies that appear from the windows of a train carriage. They will shoot back at the player and throw various objects. Players can hit the DUCK button to avoid the enemy attacks. A woman will appear at regular intervals offering the player a bag of money, if the player shoots the woman, a life is lost. After the shooting sequence has been completed, the game will start over again with an increased level of difficulty.</desc>

Fantasy Zone (c) 1986 Sega Enterprises, Limited.

The Fantasy Zone is under attack by an army of ruthless, yet undeniably cute, alien enemies. A fearless space fighter by the name of &apos;Opa-opa&apos; (a craft that is as cute as the game&apos;s enemies, featuring wings and feet - the latter appearing whenever the player flies down to ground level at the bottom of the screen) must stop the alien invasion to restore peace to the Fantasy Zone, as well as finding his missing father, &apos;Opapa&apos;, in the process.

Each level has a number of large, enemy generating ships, that produce a constant stream of enemies to attack the player. While the enemies the generators produce can either be shot or avoided, the generators themselves MUST be destroyed. Once the generators are gone, an end-of-level ship will appear that must be beaten to complete the level.

Fantasy Zone is rendered with the surreal, brightly coloured graphics that typify many Japanese videogames; with an equally abstract approach to in-game weapons: with that cartoon comedy staple, the &apos;anvil&apos;, making an appearance.</desc>

Once again you control Opa-Opa, a pretty colored ship with wings on its side and must destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of enemies all in a row.</desc>

Fighter&apos;s History (c) 1993 Data East Corporation.

Fighter&apos;s History is the first attempt of Data East to enter in competition with Capcom and its omnipresent Street Fighter II. Because the many similarities shared by the game with the Capcom masterpiece (like the character select screen, the vs and winner/loser screens, the controls and the design and moves of some characters), Fighter&apos;s History was at least simply stamped by most of the  players like another SFII clone, and in this way remained ignored and obscured to the mass audience.

Although time after, the many beat&apos;em up fans learnt to appreciate this maybe too underestimated fighting game, especially for its combo system, quite simple to execute even for those players not so able with timing and button pressing, and for its fast gameplay: at this purpose most of the contribution was made by the updated version released in 1994, Fighter&apos;s History Dynamite (known as Karnov&apos;s Revenge in USA and Europe) that made the gameplay more polished. Despite this at least Fighter&apos;s History never reached that great success that maybe Data East still tried to achieve.

Players choose one of 9 international fighters and battle to be the best in the world. Every character has his ending sequence and his own stage. There are also two not-selectable bosses to challenge for reach the end, and the last one of them is real surprising!</desc>

Frenzy (c) 1982 Stern.

A sequel to the 1980 game, &quot;Berzerk&quot;, &quot;Frenzy&quot; once again has the player battling through a maze of rooms populated by deadly, armed robots. The robots now come in two forms, &apos;Skeletons&apos; and &apos;Eyeballs&apos;, and the object of the game is to destroy as many robots as possible before escaping the room through one of the open doorways. 

If the player lingers too long in a room, a bouncing smiley face known as &apos;Evil Otto&apos; appears and relentlessly chases the player. Otto will destroy any robots in his way and can pass through walls. Unlike the first game, Otto can now be killed. Shooting him once changes him from a smiley to a neutral face, another shot converts him to a frowning face and a third shot kills him. However, When he returns Otto will move faster than before he was killed.

Another difference from &quot;Berzerk&quot; is that walls are no longer electrified and deadly to the touch. Some walls are composed of dots that can be shot; this opens up strategies such as blasting a hole in the side of a room through which to escape when in trouble. Solid white walls are indestructible and now reflect shots. If the dotted walls are also white, all walls, whether solid or dotted, reflect shots. As such, players can trick robots into killing themselves by standing on the opposite side of a reflective wall and letting them shoot themselves. However, players can also be killed by their own shots.

After you escape from a maze, the next maze you enter will have a closed gate at your starting point.

Around the outer perimeter of the maze, there are &quot;joint&quot; dots about every 10 pixels. They can neither be destroyed nor reflect shots, and they are the same color as the closed gates.

Each fourth room features interactive, decorative elements that drastically effect how the room is played. The elements and order in which they appear are:

* BIG OTTO ROOM
If the player kills Evil Otto, not only does he immediately re-spawn as usual, but the Big Otto sends four additional Ottos into play, all moving at top speed. The Big Otto starts out with closed eyes and a neutral mouth, but if you kill Evil Otto, the Big Otto will frown and open his glowing red eyes as he sends the additional Ottos into play. If at any time you die, the Big Otto will smile, but his eyes will remain the same as before, either closed or open.

* POWER PLANT ROOM
Shooting the power plant once will disable it and all robots in the room will stop movin</desc>

Gaia Crusaders (c) 1999 Noise Factory.

Gaia Crusaders is a one or two-player side-scrolling beat-em-up in which players must battle Satan and his army of demons that have captured and taken over the world. Players select a character from a choice of five combatants known as &apos;Elemental Warriors&apos;. Each of the characters possesses either Wind strength, Fire strength, or a mix of the two. 

The game has the standard punch and kick attack moves as well as magical special moves. Combos can be strung together by switching quickly between kicking and punching. Players can also perform a &apos;super attack&apos; by pressing the jump, punch and kick buttons simultaneously, this hits many enemies at once but costs the player character some health. It&apos;s also possible to raise a shield by pressing jump and kick simultaneously.

At regular intervals coloured spheres appear, players can pick these up to gain a magical attack. The effects of the magic attack differs depending on the player character. If the magic matches the character&apos;s elemental attribute (fire, wind or both), they will gain a special, screen-clearing attack. Otherwise, they earn a powerful special attack. 

In addition to the elemental spheres, there are two types of bombs that also appear, both of which detonate immediately once picked up. The first is an earthquake that hits all on-screen enemies and inflicts a large amount of damage. The second is a random bomb that sends out pillars of fire, hurting any enemies they come into contact with. There are also explosive boxes that can be kicked at enemies to keep them at bay. One last notable item is the sword, which functions much like weapons that can be found on the ground in many other beat &apos;em ups. A boss battle awaits players at the end of each stage.

Gaia Crusaders is heavily influenced by another scrolling beat-em-up, Capcom&apos;s 1989 classic, Final Fight and also, to a lesser degree, by Sega&apos;s Golden Axe (the latter being the use of the Magical Attack acting as a smart bomb).

The game&apos;s five selectable characters and their attributes are as follows:

** Fred Sathal - Magical Attribute: Fire and Wind **
Fred Sathal is one of the faster characters and has some very acrobatic combo moves.

** Jimi Isaak - Magical Attribute: Wind **
Isaak is the all-around fighter with average speed, defense and power.

** Kohen - Magical Attribute: Fire **
Kohen is a priestess who always carries a piece of paper inscribed with a magi</desc>

Gaiapolis - Koganedaka no Ken (c) 1993 Konami.

A far away land filled with monsters and under the hand of an evil king is on the edge of destruction. Only a small group of brave heroes (a dragon warrior, a fairy &amp; a prince) dare to step forth to look for the legendary sword of the Golden Hawk hidden in the flying citadel known as Gaiapolis in order to topple the evil king and bring peace to this troubled land. Features some very nice 2-D graphics, awesome character &amp; enemy artwork designs, a superb soundtrack and addicting hack &amp; slash action with some RPG characteristics (characters &amp; weapons level up, plenty of magic spells &amp; summons). If you enjoyed Taito&apos;s Cadash, this game is for you!

After conquering his home galaxy, the next galaxy that Gildy planned on invading was the Galmedes Galaxy. In response, the unified forces of the planets of the Galmedes Galaxy have created a powerful space fighter known as the LEPTON (Launched Electro-Projectile Thermal Osmotic Nullifier). Two pilots, Foo and Bar, are selected to launch the LEPTON fighters against the invading Gastonian Forces.</desc>

Garou - Mark of the Wolves (c) 1999 SNK.

Garou: Mark of the Wolves is a one-on-one fighting game and is the 9th title in SNK&apos;s Fatal Fury series. Ten years after crime-lord Geese Howard&apos;s death, the city of Southtown is now a peaceful place, leading it to be known as the Second Southtown. A new fighting tournament called King of Fighters: Maximum Mayhem is created, with several characters related to fighters from the previous &quot;King of Fighters&quot; tournaments participating.

The game features 12 characters and foregoes the plane-switching style of its predecessors in favour of standard, single-plane battles. Garou introduced the &quot;Tactical Offense Position&quot; (T.O.P.), a special area on the fighter&apos;s life gauge. When the gauge reaches this area, the character enters the T.O.P. mode, granting them the ability to use T.O.P. attack, gradual life recovery, and increased attack damage. 

The game also introduced the Just Defend system, which rewards players who successfully block an attack at the last moment, granting them a small amount of health recovery and the ability to immediately counter-attack out of block stun.

If players win all rounds with a ranking of AAA, they will face the boss &apos;Kain R. Heinlein&apos;, defeating him unlocks a special ending. If the AAA requirements are not met, Grant will be the final boss and there will be no special ending. Additionally, before facing Grant players will face a mid-boss, who, depending on which character the player is using, can be any character from the game&apos;s cast.</desc>

Gauntlet (c) 1985 Atari Games.

Gauntlet is a maze-based shoot-em-up for up to four players. Heavily influenced by classic fantasy conventions, players take on the role of either Thor the Warrior, Thyra the Valkyrie, Merlin the Wizard, or Questor the Elf and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes. Competitive play is encouraged as players must fight for the limited amount of food, treasure, magic potions and power-up items that litter the dungeons. 

Each of Gauntlet&apos;s four characters have different strengths and weaknesses: Thyra has the strongest armour, Thor is best at hand-to-hand combat, Questor has the fastest speed and Merlin has the most powerful magic attacks. The object of the game is simply to survive as long as possible while exploring Gauntlet&apos;s mazes in search of treasure, food, magic potions and, ultimately, the exit that leads to the next dungeon. 

The potions - shown as blue bottles - that litter the levels offer either improved character abilities (such as &apos;speed&apos; or &apos;extra shot power&apos;) or can be used as a &apos;smart bomb&apos;, destroying some or all of the on-screen monsters. Potions are also the only way to kill the game&apos;s &apos;Death&apos; character that appears in many of the stages. Magic potions can be kept and used at the player&apos;s discretion by pressing &apos;Magic&apos; button, although each potion can only be used once. 

The first seven mazes are always the same, but from level 8 onwards, players will find themselves on any one of over a hundred different mazes. If players survive for long enough, the mazes will be repeated in a different order. How long a player lasts depends upon the player&apos;s &apos;health&apos; level. Health continually depletes as time progresses and further health is lost by contact with various monsters or their projectiles. Health can be replenished by consuming the food found in the mazes or by inserting more credits. The many treasure chests that litter the levels can be plundered for points, and collecting treasure increases a player&apos;s score multiplier when two or more players are playing the game.</desc>

Gauntlet II (c) 1986 Atari Games.

Gauntlet II is a direct sequel to the legendary maze-based fantasy themed shoot-em-up, released a year earlier. Atari chose not to tinker with the core game-play mechanic to any great degree, opting instead to enhance the already excellent multi-player action that had created such a stir upon the original game&apos;s release.

As with its prequel, up to four players once again take on the role of either &apos;Thor the Warrior&apos;, &apos;Thyra the Valkyrie&apos;, &apos;Merlin the Wizard&apos;, or &apos;Questor the Elf&apos; and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes, collecting potions, food and treasure as they searched for the exit that would lead them to the next dungeon.

Changes to the sequel included the ability for players to play whatever character they wanted, even if that character was already in play. Characters were now colour-coded and players would find themselves taking on the role of &apos;Blue Elf&apos;, &apos;Green Wizard&apos;, etc. New in-game speech was added to allow for the new player definitions.

Other changes included the ability to &apos;bounce&apos; shots off walls - known as &apos;Reflective Shots&apos; - providing the correct potion was picked up. As well as new potions, Gauntlet II also featured several new monsters. The most notorious of the new additions was the Fire-breathing Dragon that guards the exit to some dungeons. This powerful creature takes multiple hits to kill and defeating it would see the players rewarded with a permanent potion and a bag of treasure.

Another notable addition was the &apos;It&apos; monster: any player who was tagged by the creature would suddenly find that all of that level&apos;s monsters would ONLY chase the tagged player, completely ignoring the presence of all other players. The only way to remove this curse was to tag another player, thus making them &apos;it&apos;.

New level elements were also added to further increase variety. These included dungeons with entirely invisible walls, magical walls (which changed into monsters or items when hit), stun tiles (which stunned any player that walked on them) and exits that flashed between functioning and non-functioning.</desc>

Genpei Toumaden (c) 1986 Namco.

Genpei Touma Den is a multi-genre birds-eye view action, 2D side-scroller beat &apos;em up, and 2D side-scroller platform arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986 only in Japan. 

The character controlled by the player is that of a real Japanese samurai, Taira no Kagekiyo, who fell at the Battle of Dan-no-ura at the end of the Genpei War in 1185. Over eight hundred years later he is resurrected and has to make his way over the Imperial Regalia of Japan - fighting other characters who actually existed such as Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Saito Musashibo Benkei on his travels, as well as collecting the three sacred game items and defeating his arch-enemy Minamoto no Yoritomo.

This game has three types of stages: Small Mode (standard), Big Mode (with large characters, and usually boss fights), and Overhead Mode (like Small Mode, but as the name suggests, viewed from an overhead perspective). Most stages have torii (a gate) at the end of them, which are used to transport the player to a different stage. Most of the Small Mode and Overhead Mode stages have multiple torii at the end of them, which lead to different places on the map of the Imperial Regalia. Big Mode stages, however, only have one torii at the end of them. If Kagekiyo is unlucky enough to fall into a pit in any of the Small Mode stages, he will end up in a non-standard Overhead Mode stage known as the &quot;Pit Stage&quot; (from which there are only two ways to escape - and one of these two does not always work).

The game also features the Sanzu River, the place believed in Japanese Buddhism to separate &quot;the current life&quot; and &quot;the afterlife&quot;, resembling the concept of the Underworld or Hell. Therefore, mythological characters such as Emma-O, God of the Underworld, and Sun Goddess Amaterasu, appear in this game (the former in the aforementioned &quot;Pit Stage&quot; and the latter in a non-standard Small Mode stage called the &quot;Bonus Stage&quot;).</desc>

Ghost Pilots (c) 1991 SNK.

Ghost Pilots is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players set in World War II. An ambitious Nazi general has sent his forces against the Allies andwo freelance ace pilots  called Tom Phillips and Charlie Stingley, nicknamed &apos;Ghost Pilots&apos;, set off in their seaplanes to combat the Axis forces head on.

Before starting a stage, the player must choose one of two bomb types. In one of the two stages after the first, the player also has the option to choose a third unique bomb type (napalm bomb in the land strike stage and air mines in the air strike stage). At the start of the game a player starts with three bombs and can collect up to a maximum of nine bombs. In a two-player game, both players cannot choose the same bomb type.

Enemies consist of tanks, gunboats, jets and a number of other military units. Shooting a row of red planes grants collectible power-ups giving either stronger and more widespread firepower, or additional bombs and extra lives. Certain medium-sized enemies destroyed grant collectible bonus stars for additional score. The player loses a life if the seaplane is hit by enemy projectiles orcollides with enemy craft.

An end-of-level boss fight awaits players at the end of every stage.</desc>

Golden Axe (c) 1989 Sega.

Golden Axe is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which up to three warriors take up arms to rescue the kidnapped King and his Queen from the evil Death Adder.

The game&apos;s three different playable characters are an Amazonian warrior named Tyris Flare, a Barbarian hero named Ax Battler, and a Viking dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead. Each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will make the character charge and smash into opponents.

At certain points during the game, players will come across enemies riding creatures (such as dragons). If the player knocks the original rider from the saddle, the created can be mounted and used against the enemy.

At certain points during a level, as well as on the between-stage intermittent levels, Thieves appear carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the Thieves causing them to drop food and magic potions - the latter of which are used to create a special magical attack that damages or kills all on-screen enemies.

Each of the game&apos;s heroes uses a different kind of magic: Ax Battler uses Earth magic, Tyris uses fire magic and Gilius uses lightning magic. In addition: each player character also carries a different weapon: Tyris and Ax Battler both use swords while Gilius wields an axe.

Golden Axe consists of 9 levels, although only 5 of these are true levels as every 2nd stage is a short intermittent level featuring only the sack-carrying Goblins.

Once Golden Axe has been beaten, an end sequence is a scene of a video arcade, in which the game&apos;s characters jump out of the arcade cabinet and chase the game&apos;s players out of the arcade and down the street.</desc>

Green Beret (c) 1985 Konami.

Green Beret is a sideways-scrolling action/platform game set during the Cold War, in which a US Special Forces Marine must infiltrate a Russian military base to save four POW&apos;s from being executed by firing squad. 

Initially, the soldier is armed with only a combat knife, but by killing the certain enemy troops, players can obtain either a three-shot flamethrower, a four-shot RPG, or a three-pack of hand grenades. 

The Marine can jump or lie down to avoid the enemy bullets, as well as climbing ladders to avoid enemies and projectiles, as well as the flashing land mines that litter the levels. While it&apos;s possible to remain still in one area to rack up points, if players take too long to proceed, the game will start sending out tougher enemies and eventually a stealth-like bomber will appear to take out the player. There is also an unseen time limit that will kill off players if they take too long to complete the stage. 

The game has four stages in total: a missile base, a harbour, an air Base and a Siberian POW Camp. At the end of each stage the Marine will face a group of enemies specific to that stage: Stage 1 ends with a truckload of running and jump-kicking soldiers, Stage 2 with a pack of fierce dogs and their handlers, Stage 3 with three Gyro-copters and Stage 4 with a number of multi-shot flamethrower operators. 

The game is completed once the captives have been rescued at the end of the fourth stage, after which the action starts over with an increased level of difficulty.</desc>

Gridlee (c) 1983 Videa.

A game where the player controls a bottle-shaped character named Gridlee who has to catch colored balls (or the crystal) for points &amp; shoot the enemies while they are overhead. Shooting enemies also awards the player points, but more importantly, the only way to pass a level is to shoot every enemy. The player knows when the enemy is overhead by looking at his shadow on the grid. Each red ball is worth 100 points. The green ball appears after catching 3 red balls &amp; isworth 500 points. The crystal appears after catching 3 red balls, a green ball and 3 more red balls. It is worth 1000 points and must be caught before it lands since it will not bounce, but instead disappear. The green balls bounce very high and can bounce far, making them hard to catch. The player has to avoid touching the bouncing enemies, the charged tiles that flash after enemies land on them, and the worm that moves horizontally across the tiles while charging them. There is a character named Igor that spits a sticky gum-like substance, which turns the tile it lands on pink and causes Gridlee to move slow when walking on that tile. Also, if there&apos;s one enemy left bouncing for a while as the player catches the
balls, the enemy eventually charges tile after tile, which makes it dangerous for the player as the walking space is limited.</desc>

Guardians / Denjinmakai II (c) 1995 Banpresto.

Guardians is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players featuring eight selectable characters. Controls consist of an eight-way joystick and three buttons; standard attack, jump and special attack. Pressing the standard attack button repeatedly when attacking will trigger a combo from the player-character. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. 

Enemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too often or when the player moves to a new area.

Each player-character has both a life bar and a power meter. The power meter allows for the special attacks to be made, either by pressing both standard attack and jump simultaneously, or by pressing the special attack button. These powerful attacks reduce the power meter but it does replenish itself after a few seconds. However, some of the player&apos;s health is lost in the process. Health levels can be replenished by finding food that lies hidden in breakable crates scattered through the stages.

A powerful boss enemy awaits player at the end of each stage.</desc>

Hard Head (c) 1988 SunA.

Players control the character Hard Head, who can use a bubble gun to entrap enemies, then jump on their heads to defeat them. Often compared to Nintendo&apos;s Super Mario Bros., the game met with some favorable reviews on release and its offbeat sense of humor has been noted. Enemies include monsters and ducks. Hard Head can use his head to break bricks, some of which contain power-ups. Levels are completed by finding a soccer ball and kicking it through a goal to finish the stage. There are 16 levels in total. A two-player simultaneous mode is also available, allowing another player to control the second Hard Head twin.

SunA subsequently released a sequel to the game, Hard Head 2, which featured the same characters but different gameplay.</desc>

Hopping Mappy (c) 1986 Namco.

In Hopping Mappy players control the Micro Police mouse, Mappy as he bounces on a pogo stick to run circles around pink cats, called Meowkies, who patrol either vertically or horizontally. There is also Nyamco, a cat who patrols in a zigzag pattern, but he needs to take occasional breaks. There are eight treasures that a player must grab to complete a round, except on the bonus round where the player will just want to collect all the balloons that he can. The main intrigue here is getting past a blockade of Meowkies. 

The player controls are simple - Mappy can bounce in any of the four directions, the only places he can land are the centres of the checkerboard squares (making for very few locations overall), and he will move at the same speed as the cats. If the player pushes the accelerator button and runs around, he will go twice as fast. When the cats have sped up (after a &quot;Hurry Up&quot; warning has appeared) they will match Mappy&apos;s accelerated speed.</desc>

いっき (c) 1985 Sun Electronics Corporation.
(Ikki)

A maze/top-down shooter game.

Set in the ancient medieval Japan, where a poor farming village is planning an insurrection to overthrow their feudal overlord. However, the only participants in the revolt are the player&apos;s character, Gonbe, and the optional second-player character, Tago, and the player battles against an army of ninjas, armed samurai a ghosts, and foot soldiers. The game has a great and colorful levels design, inspired in customs and myths Japanese of that time.

The character&apos;s movement is controlled with an 8-way joystick, and pressing the single button allows the player to attack by throwing a sickle. The direction in which the sickle is thrown cannot be determined by the player, and the weapon will automatically head towards the closest enemy. This forces an emphasis on avoiding attacks rather than attacking aggressively. The right side of the screen displays the player&apos;s points, along with a map of the level. The location of koban coins is displayed on this map, but players must circumvent walls and other barriers to go to those locations. The level is completed when the player picks up all 8 gold koban coins which are spread throughout the map, or if they capture the daikan (Japanese feudal lord) that can randomly appear during the level. 
The player loses a life when they come in contact with any of the enemy characters or projectiles. 

A bonus stage exist and some extras actions gameplay like grab a key to save a prisoner and especial items to increase speed of the character.</desc>

Rattlesnakes and Thuggee guards patrol the ledges and must be avoided or whipped. Players must be careful to not fall from a ledge or a life is lost. Mola Ram himself occasionally appears and throws flaming hearts at Indy, these must be whipped or avoided.

* The second zone is a recreation of the famous mine cart chase from the movie and the player must guide Indy&apos;s cart to the bottom of the mine, keeping ahead of enemy carts and avoiding dead ends and track-side enemies. The cart can be steered left and right to different tracks to avoid obstacles.

* The third zone takes place in the temple itself and Indy must make his way to the altar and retrieve the Sankara stone. Indy must avoid guards, rattlesnakes and flaming hearts thrown by Mola Ram. Once a Sankara stone has been retrieved Indy must escape the temple through one of the four doors that opens.

The zones are then repeated twice more to collect the two remaining stones, although the lay-out and difficulty of the zones is different. Once all three Sankara stones have been collected, Indy must work his way through a final mine and mine-cart section, before making his escape on a rope bridge and facing Mola Ram for the final time. 

*Note* The final rope bridge section doesn&apos;t appear if the game has been played on the &apos;Easy&apos; level. Instead, a message will appear stating that Indy escaped on the rope bridge. The player is then returned to the game, starting over with a higher level of difficulty.</desc>

Battle against the insect army with your special insecticide weapons.

The Burgoid, a tribe of midgets with dreams of conquest, have turned insects into cyborgs and formed them into a vast army which is now on the move and intending to invade planet Earth! 

To wipe out these mega-insects - which are invulnerable to ordinary weapons - humans have created an insect-sized warrior called Yanmer. The warrior wears a suit, giving him special powers and wings that are more efficient than a jet engine. 

You are Yanmer, and your mission is to destroy the Burgoid Monarch and save mankind from disaster!</desc>

J.J. Squawkers (c) 1993 Athena / Able.

J.J. Squarkers is a scrolling run &apos;n&apos; gun platform shoot-em-up for one or two players in which several residents from the peaceful village if Pistachio have been kidnapped. Most of the remaining villagers have fallen under a mysterious spell, making them violent. Players take on the roles of two ducks called &apos;Ani Karasukun&apos; and &apos;Ototo Karasukun&apos; who set out to defeat the enemy minions and restore peace to their village. 

The ducks can fire projectiles to defeat the abstract enemies they face, with their default weapon being tomatoes. Other weapons - as well as bonus and health power-ups - become available when certain enemies are killed. Available weapons include pumpkins, watermelon seeds, screws and slinkys wearing red sneakers. 

Each weapon has different strengths and weaknesses; for example the slinkys simply walk in a straight line until they either meet obstacles or the edge of screen, making it easy to deal with enemies from a distance. On the other hand, watermelon seeds can only be thrown a short distance but several are thrown at once. This effectively gives players a &apos;spread shot&apos; and is more effective when multiple enemies are attacking from several directions at once.

J.J. Squarkers consists of five stages with a powerful end-of-level guardian waiting at the end of each.</desc>

Joust (c) 1982 Williams.

Joust is a platform-based action combat game for one or two-players (with the two-player game offering either team-up OR head-to-head combat; the first time arcade gamers were given this choice) in which each player controls a knight riding on the back of a flying ostrich. 

The object of the game is to progress through platform-based levels by defeating groups of buzzard-riding enemy knights. This is achieved by &apos;jousting&apos;; both enemy and player knights carry a lance and must fly around the level (actioned by repeatedly hitting the &apos;Flap&apos; button) trying to oust rival knights from their steeds by ramming them with the lance. This can only be achieved if the attacking rider is above the enemy knight when the lance connects. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other, but if a player is lower than their enemy at the instant of contact, they themselves will be knocked from their steed and lose a life. 

A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls to the bottom of the screen. This must be quickly collected by players as if the egg lands on a platform and isn&apos;t retrieved in time, it will eventually hatch into another enemy knight that must be defeated again. 

Joust features three different types of enemy knights - Bounder, Hunter, and Shadow Lord - with each earning players different points values when defeated. A pterodactyl will appear after a predetermined time to hunt the players. 

Accurately navigating the player Knights can be initially quite difficult as control is strongly affected by both gravity and inertia. Players can lose a life by either being knocked from their steed by an enemy knight, or by falling into the lava pit at the bottom of each level.</desc>

Jungle Hunt (c) 1982 Taito American Corp.

Export release. Game developed in Japan. See the original &quot;Jungle King&quot; for more information about the game itself (except for differences and ports listed here).

- TRIVIA -

Released in October 1982, this reworked version of &quot;Jungle King&quot; was the end result of a copyright infringement lawsuit filed against Taito by the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan.

Here&apos;s what makes Jungle Hunt different from Jungle King: 
* Music is played at the places where the Tarzan yell was originally heard - at the beginning of the game and at the end of the avalanche stage - the same music that plays upon completion of the river stage. 
* The player character is a safari-suited jungle explorer clad in a pith helmet, jacket, and shorts, instead of the Tarzan look-alike. 
* The life-lines that the player character swings on between the trees in the first stage are ropes instead of vines.

The original version of the game, known as Jungle King, featured a character who looked like the well known (and very much copyrighted) Tarzan. The character even sounded like Tarzan when he bellowed out the famous scream after finishing the boulder stage (and at the beginning of the game). So, for legal reasons, the name was changed to &apos;Jungle Hunt&apos; and the player character was changed to resemble a classic safari-suited jungle explorer complete with the standard issue pith helmet, jacket, and shorts. The bellowed scream at the end of the boulder stage was also entirely removed, replaced by the music from the end of the river stage.

A Jungle Hunt unit appears in the 1983 movie &apos;WarGames&apos;. 

Michael Torcello holds the official record for this game with 1,510,220 points.

MB (Milton Bradley) released a board-game based on this video-game (same name) in 1983.

Jungle King (c) 1982 Taito.

Jungle King is a jungle adventure game where players take on the role of Jungle King, a Tarzan-like jungle man, who is going in search of his Jungle Princess, who has been kidnapped by a pair of barbaric cannibals. 

Jungle King has four stages, each with its own unique scenarios, so each stage could be considered a separate game in its own right. 

It is noticeable that this game scrolls from right to left, while the vast majority of scrollers go from left to right, although most people probably wouldn&apos;t even notice that. 

Jungle King&apos;s gameplay is very similar to that of Activision&apos;s &quot;Pitfall&quot;, a classic arcade game released on many home computer and console formats of the time. 

The game&apos;s stages are as follows: 
* The first stage, which may have been the best stage in the game, is set in a forest with a series of swinging vines. Players must use the JUMP button to move from right to left across the vines, while avoiding the monkeys that can send Jungle King falling to the ground. This level is easy to master, but players must time their jumps carefully to make it to the next vine. 
* The second stage is set under a jungle river. Players must guide Jungle King through a river infested with alligators and crocodiles. This stage features a &apos;breath meter&apos; that must be carefully watched to avoid drowning (players simply swim up to the surface to get more air). Jungle King is armed with a knife with which he can stab the crocs and gators, but this can only be done when their mouths are not fully open. 
* The third stage is an avalanche with boulders rolling down a hill. The player simply uses the joystick to control Jungle King&apos;s climbing speed up the hill, and the JUMP button to leap over rolling boulders until they reach the end of the stage. 
* The fourth and final stage has the player guiding Jungle King through a cannibal village. Jungle King must jump over the cannibals while their spears are down, and eventually make his way towards his Jungle Princess, who is being lowered into a pot to be boiled for supper. 

On completion of the game, players are rewarded with a short &apos;I Love You&apos; ending, and then the game begins again with increased difficulty.</desc>

Kaiser Knuckle (c) 1994 Taito.

A one-on-one fighting game featuring nine selectable characters and three end bosses, controlled with a single joystick and six buttons. In addition to the usual kicks and punches, each character also has a number of special moves, that can be utilized via complex joystick and button combinations. In the one player game, players can chose their first opponent, with subsequent opponents chosen randomly by the game.

Unusually for a game of this type, Kaiser Knuckle features blood; something that had hitherto only been associated with Midway&apos;s &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series. The blood option can be switched off in the game&apos;s dip settings.

Kaiser Knuckle was Taito&apos;s answer to Capcom&apos;s Street Fighter II during the fighting game trend of the 90s. Despite showing highly detailed and unique content in the arcades, it didn&apos;t catch enough attention to become a success and was never ported to home consoles.

A unique feature is that this was the first and only fighting game to feature five different strength for basic punches and kicks.

Another unique feature are power zones, these are activated when landing a special move when a character&apos;s Power (Crush in the Japanese version) meter is full. Power zones contain electricity or fire that can help improve a character&apos;s special move. Stage backgrounds can also be destroyed by the combat, getting hit fills the Power meter and when a special move connects when it is full, it greatly damages the background walls and can unlock the fire or electric zones found in levels.</desc>

Chatan Yarakuu Shanku - The Karate Tournament (c) 1992 Mitchell.

Karate Tournament is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players, based on the ancient and most well known of martial arts, Karate.

Players enter a karate tournament - having first selected their preferred skill level, from either White, Brown or Black belt - and fight against a number of progressively tougher opponents. Each victory awards the player with a higher belt grade within their current belt colour - white grade six to white grade five, for example - and if the player wins the tournament, he or she is awarded a higher belt colour and the game ends. If players chooses to play the game on the &apos;Black Belt&apos; skill level, defeating opponents is awarded with a higher grade, or &apos;dan&apos; of Black Belt.

Karate Tournament uses a distinctive graphical technique in that it &apos;morphs&apos; some of the combatants&apos; movement graphics to simulate speed and motion blur. The game was also unique upon its release in that, in a world of &quot;Street Fighters&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombats&quot; - replete with fantastical special moves - Karate Tournament was a genuine simulation of a recognized martial art; something not really seen since the first appearance of Data East&apos;s legendary genre-defining fighter, &quot;Karate Champ&quot;, released eight years&apos; earlier in 1984.</desc>

To further make your travels a hazard, different enemies attempt to end Karnov&apos;s life prematurely and prevent him from getting to the treasure. To aid Karnov in his adventures, he has certain items that he can draw from his inventory. In addition, there are other items that can make Karnov a potent foe of those wishing to harm him. You must complete each scene in order to advance to the next scene. All in a days work of a hearty explorer.</desc>

Karnov&apos;s Revenge (c) 1994 Data East Corp.

The quest to defeat the mysterious Baron of Battlers, the mysterious &quot;K&quot;, is on. In order to get to this grotesque gladiator, you need to fight your way through 13 with the most skilled, most deadly of all combatants in the world of physical contact. Use your powers of pulverization, psychic energy blasts, and ridiculous strength to become the explosive fighting god in FIGHTER&apos;S HISTORY DYNAMITE!!!

Don&apos;t just participate in history, MAKE IT! The sequel of the first &quot;Fighter&apos;s History&quot;, this time ported in the Neo Geo MVS Hardware. In this new version of the original game several changes and improvements were made to enhance the gameplay: now the battles are faster and more technical, with the usual friendly combo system that makes the fight so spectacular. There are also some powerful hidden moves added for most of the characters. Even the graphic was slightly enhanced, with a nice color palette and some wonderful backgrounds (especially Zazie&apos;s).

The game actually suffered from the reputation to be a &apos;SFII clone&apos; given by the general opinion from the first episode. Thanks to this new chapter of the saga, which was particularly appreciated by the Neo Geo fans because it is one of the rare &apos;SFII style&apos; beat&apos;em ups on the Neo Geo this changed.

A really nice and classical beat&apos;em up, still worthy to be played, especially for the real fans of the 2-D beat&apos;em up.</desc>

The King of Fighters &apos;98 - The Slugfest (c) 1998 SNK.

The King of Fighters &apos;98: The Slugfest is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players, featuring 38 selectable characters. As with previous games in the series, players can choose between two different playing styles: Advance and Extra. 

* Extra is similar to &quot;King of Fighters &apos;94&quot; and is more suited to defensive play, as the fighters only have one power gauge and cannot run. They can instead sidestep to avoid incoming attacks and can also perform unlimited super moves when their energy is low. 

* Advanced mode gives the fighters the evasive roll introduced in &quot;King of Fighters &apos;96&quot; and lets them store up to three full power gauges at once. This means they can choose to expend a gauge to get a damage boost, rather than letting it happen automatically. It also allows fighters to use more than one gauge to inflict more powerful versions of their super moves (instead of having to wait until their health is low). Fighters can also expend a gauge to quick roll out of an attack after successfully blocking it.

Both the &apos;Extra&apos; and &apos;Advanced&apos; modes have been tweaked since the previous game. Unlike KOF &apos;97, fighters will return to normal if they perform a Super Special Move in MAX state. Also, when a fighter loses a round, they are given a handicap in their favour. In Extra mode, the time it takes to charge their power gauge to its maximum level is shortened. In Advance mode, the fighter&apos;s stock capacity of Power Gauges is increased by one.</desc>

The King of Fighters 2002 - Challenge to Ultimate Battle (c) 2002 Playmore Corp.

The King of Fighters 2002: Challenge to Ultimate Battle is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players and is the ninth game in the series.

The game discarded the 4-on-4 &quot;Striker Match&quot; format used in the previous three games in the series and returned to the 3-on-3 Battle format used prior to &quot;King of Fighters &apos;98&quot;.

The King of Fighters 2002 also revamped the Power Gauge system into a format similar to the one used in KOF &apos;97. As with previous games in the series, the Power Gauge is filled as the player attacks their opponent or performs Special Moves. The number of Power Gauges the player can stock up is increased by one with each member of the team. For example, the first member of the team can stock up to three Power Gauges, while the third member can stock up to five. 

A single Power Gauge stock can be used to either perform a Counter-attack and evasion technique while guarding against an opponent&apos;s attack, to use a Super Special Move, or to initiate the MAX Activation state. The same case also applies to the 1-on-1 format, in which the Power Gauge the player can stock up is also increased by one with each round loss (for example, on the first round, the player can stock up to three Power Gauges, while losing two rounds allows the player to stock up to five).

During MAX Activation, the player&apos;s offensive and defensive strength is increased for a short period. In this state, a Super Special Move can be used without consuming Power Gauge stock. There are also MAX Super Special Moves, which are Super moves that can only be performed during MAX Activation with one Power Gauge stock, and MAX2 moves, that require two stocks while low on health.</desc>

Koutetsu Yousai Strahl (c) 1992 UPL.

The game takes place in modern times where a great depression has swept over the world. Amidst the depression and its riots of jobless workers, a mad scientist starts his plan of world domination. Taking command in the titular fortress orbiting Earth, the evil Doctor Gegeben Funkerun uses his own robots, flying fortresses and mercenaries to wreak havoc across the globe until all his demands are met. Assisting the attacked and weakened governments, workers across the nations help develop a series of jet fighters called the Aizerun Geist to use against the forces of Dr. Funkerun and save the world.

Before each stage begins, players are given a choice of weapons to purchase at a hangar for the Aizerun Geist. There are four weapons within three tiers to choose from including Main Attack, Sub Weapon and Bomb. Of the Main Attack the player can choose Twin Shot, Laser, Heavy Laser and the Charge Shot. Of the Sub Weapons, players can choose additional firepower, Homing Missiles, Shielded Options or an energy barrier. Players can stock up on multiple bombs including Small bombs, rockets, larger bombs or napalm.

The Aizerun Geist provides tactical advantages during combat with the use of its manually directional Sub Weapon. Players are able to direct additional firepower in five directions including vertical and horizontal by pressing the bomb button while firing. The game runs for six stages through various settings such as a jungle, stormy skies, Tokyo and Fortress Strahl itself.</desc>

Last Duel - Inter Planet War 2012 (c) 1988 Capcom Company, Limited.

Taking place in the year 2012 in an alternate galaxy, Last Duel involves the struggle between two planets Mu and Bacula. On planet Bacula, a strong warrior tribe known as the Galden rose to immense military power and conquered all of the societies on the planet. Unsatisfied with conquering just one planet, the Galden decided to conquer a neighboring terrestrial planet, Mu. Using advanced bioships, star fighters, and motor vehicles, the Galden invaded Mu, destroying many of its cities and taking the planet&apos;s ruler Queen Sheeta hostage. The remaining royal guards of Mu are deployed in space fighters that can transform into cars to rescue the queen and crush the Galden forces.

The player alternates each level between using car and space ship. The vehicle has two main attacks one of which varies depending on the form the vehicle took. In car mode, the vehicle can jump over pot holes and enemies. While in ship mode, the vehicle can perform a barrel roll, making it temporarily invincible.

The player can select Power-Ups that including a large, slow firing laser, a twin-shot, a wide shot and options that provided side attacks. Speed-Ups were only available in ship mode. Every driving section is timed and if the player is unable to reach the boss on time, they will lose a life. However, the moment the player encounters the boss, the timer will be removed.</desc>

Lazer Command (c) 1976 Meadows Games.

You have an overhead view of a maze with two sides, the sides mirror each other. The left side of the screen is yellow, and the right side is green. On each side are fifteen tanks. The object is to blow up all of the opposing players tanks (or as many as you can before the timer runs out). You can only control one tank at a time, you can move them around and blast your opponents tanks (getting the active one is usually a good idea). When you get blasted, your tank vanishes, and you must move a little blip over to another tank to resume play (this blip is invisible unless it is against a wall). You can also leave your tank and head for another one by pressing the second button. This is just a great strategic title, it holds up even today. It is really worth playing if you like that sort of thing. Just be aware that this is a two player only title, so you will need a friend to play against.</desc>

League Bowling (c) 1990 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods: &apos;Regulation&apos;, &apos;Flash&apos; and &apos;Strike 90&apos;.

The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot.

The &apos;Strike 90&apos; mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the &apos;Flash&apos; game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players&apos; scores.</desc>

Leprechaun (c) 1982 Tong Electronic.

The player controls a sleuth running through a forest, trying to get a Leprechaun&apos;s pot of gold. The pot of gold is randomly placed on the screen. When the pot of gold is touched, the player is taken to the next level. The Leprechaun chases the sleuth through the forest, trying to catch him. If he is caught, the player loses a life and starts over from the beginning of the level. After all lives are lost, the game ends. Should the Leprechaun reach the pot of gold first, it is then relocated to another forest. By touching the trees, the player&apos;s score increases, as does the value of the pot of gold. After each level and after every 30 seconds the Leprechaun&apos;s speed increases.</desc>

Liberator (c) 1982 Atari.

The Liberator controls consist of a trackball, fire button, and shield button. The player controls a coordinated attack from four star ships at the corners of the screen. The primary target of the attack are enemy bases on a rotating planet in the center of the screen. The trackball is used to move a cross-shaped cursor. The fire button fires a missile at the cursor&apos;s location from your closest ship. The shield button is used to activate force fields around the ships. The shield can only take four hits each round, and the count is shared between all ships.

At the beginning of each level, the player is flying through outer space and spaceships fly on screen from the left and right and leave in an arc. They try to ram into your ships. Note that shields do not work during this stage.

After this stage, the player is taken to a view of a rotating planet. The most prominent enemies are red flashing missile bases. They shoot missiles, fireballs, and star balls at your ships. The enemy bases can also detach from the planet, turn into satellites, and orbit the planet while shooting missiles. Once all missile bases are destroyed, the player moves onto the next level. At higher levels, there is the white master base. It is very intelligent, and it can change the direction or speed of the planet rotation to avoid getting hit.</desc>

Lizard Wizard (c) 1985 Techstar.

The player must use an eight-way joystick to take control of the Lizard Wizard, whose mission is to help free the people who are caught within the planet Zyfus. The Lizard Wizard does this by shooting the rocks that fly out of that erupting volcano at the bottom of the screen which will burst into flames if he misses them and get eaten by the dragon-like lizards for their fire. As the prisoners emerge from the volcano, the Lizard Wizard must also rescue them from the planet by taking them to the platforms on the surface. The player must also face Spydors on certain levels, which must be killed before they reach the surface.</desc>

M.I.A. - Missing in Action (c) 1989 Konami.

M.I.A. Missing in Action is a horizontally-scrolling run &apos;n&apos; gun platform game for one or two players in which Special Forces soldiers must penetrate enemy-packed combat zones to reach a POW compound and rescue captured prisoners. The rescued POWs must then be escorted safely through a final enemy-packed stage to the helicopter that awaits at the end. 

Players begin each stage armed with only a combat knife to protect them, but other weapons can be picked up from fallen enemy troops. The weapons are always carried by soldiers in red uniforms and range from an assault rifle, grenades, a flame-thrower and a bazooka. Players can carry more than one weapon and can cycle through them as needed. Each collected weapon has only a limited supply of shots.

The game&apos;s first four stages are presented in random order and may also be &quot;mirrored&quot;, switching the action from from right-to-left instead of left-to-right, increasing the game&apos;s variety and adding replay value. The &apos;POW&apos; and &apos;Helicopter&apos; stages are always the last two stages, however. 

At the end of each stage players must fight off a wave of enemy troops as well as destroy gun emplacements and watch towers. Certain sections of each stage offer players a different route, with both platforms and underground tunnels that can be utilized and explored. At least one POW must be safely escorted to the rescue Chopper to complete the final mission, after which the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.

The game consists of six stages:
* War-torn battlefield
* Airstrip
* Jungle
* Rail Yard
* POW Base
* Escort the POWs to the Helicopter

M.I.A. Missing in Action is the direct sequel to 1985&apos;s &quot;Green Beret&quot; but unlike its prequel, two-player games now have both players fighting side-by-side, rather than the alternating approach of the original game.</desc>

Magician Lord (c) 1990 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.

Magician Lord is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which players take on the roll of a wizard called Elta - the last Magician Lord - on his quest to save his homeland from the evil Gul-Agieze, who plans to resurrect the God of Destruction using 8 tomes of mystical power.

Elta has to jump, shoot and climb his way to the end of each of the game&apos;s 8 levels where he must beat a servant of Gal, along with one of Gal&apos;s sinister boss creations. To complete the game Elta must reach the final stage and defeat Az Atorse himself. If the player takes too long to complete a stage, Elta will be harassed by an invincible monster.

Elta&apos;s primary form of attack is a weak but fast-moving energy projectile that can fired in one of four directions, but by collecting the special coloured orbs that ocassionally appear, he can transform into a different form, making him more powerful and giving him new attacks.

These are the six different forms that Elta can assume by picking up the colored orbs:

* Dragon Warrior: In this form Elta attacks by breathing fire; a continuous short-range attack that, unlike the standad attack, can also be aimed diagonally.

* Waterman: The Waterman-form attacks with water grenades – blue bubbles of water that burst upon touching the ground and form into water pillars. The attack can hit several times for additional damage but only covers a small area.

* Poseidon: A more powerful version of the Waterman, Poseidon shoots wide waves of water that travel along the ground for several hits. It does severe damage and causes enemies to freeze and shatter on impact. While very powerful, this form moves very slowly.

* Shinobi: The Shinobi-form gains increased agility and attacks with powerful magical arcs of fire which are wide but slow-moving.

* Samurai: While limited in range, the Samurai-form is the only form that can attack through walls, shields or even multiple enemies, using a boomerang-like energy attack that does heavy damage.

* Raijin: The Raijin-form gives Elta&apos;s jumping ability a big boost as well as a unique attack that creates a continuous electrical field around his body.</desc>

Major Title 2 - Tournament Leader (c) 1992 Irem.

Major Title 2 is a golf game for up to four players who choose to play as one of four different golfers. Each golfer possesses a unique skill-set that influences their ability to make certain types of shots (power hitter, all-round player, technician and magician). 

The game offers a choice of two different courses and provides the usual array of game modes: tournament, match play, stroke play and a skins game.

During play, the action is presented in two different perspectives. The pre-shot perspective is a standard third-person view from behind the golfer but once the ball is hit, the view switches to a top-down perspective to track the ball in flight. Once players are on the green, a window is displayed showing a zoomed-in overhead view detailing the green&apos;s contours. 

Major Title 2 takes a simplified approach to hitting the ball. Instead of setting the power and controlling the shot, the only function of the swing meter is to select the vertical angle of the shot, which sets the amount of back or topspin applied to the ball. The strength of each swing is selected prior to the shot by setting a power gauge to one of 16 levels. 

Draw and fade can also be applied to the ball by changing the players stance prior to taking the shot. However, the game specifies the maximum distance for the putter in yards, but measures distance on the greens in meters.</desc>

Marble Madness is an abstract maze game for one or two players. The game&apos;s goal is to guide a small glass marble over a three-dimensional maze and reach the finish line before the level&apos;s timer has expired. Any seconds that remain on the timer when the finish line is crossed are carried over to the next level. 

As well as having to negotiate the marble over treacherous walkways and ramps, numerous obstacles and unfriendly creatures will try to slow the marble&apos;s progress or knock it over the edge of a platform, wasting yet more precious seconds until a replacement marble appears. The two-player game has players competing to reach the goal first.

Metal Black (c) 1991 Taito Corp.

Earth is under attack from an alien race from the &apos;Nemesis&apos; region of space, and human civilisation now stands on the brink of collapse. The invaders have utilised energy molecules - known to earth scientists as &apos;Newalones&apos; - to create powerful beam weapons with which to attack Earth. In response, Earth&apos;s scientists have developed the &apos;Black Fly&apos; project; a powerful space craft that utilises the same Newalone molecule technology of the alien aggressors.

Metal Black is a very playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up which manages to feel different to other games in the genre, due to the fact that it lacks a a player-definable weapon power-up system. Instead of collecting items that provide extra speed, different weapons etc. players must collect the clusters of &apos;Newalone&apos; molecules that float around each level. These molecule clusters will gradually increase the player ship&apos;s firepower.

As long as the Metal Black ship has sufficient firepower, players can activate the &apos;Beam Weapon&apos;, which generates a powerful energy beam that destroys everything it comes into contact with. The Beam Weapon will only last for a few seconds and its use will reduce the ship&apos;s energy levels. Once the Beam weapon de-activates, Metal Black will have vastly reduced firepower for its forward-firing laser cannon. Players must once again collect the Newalone molecule clusters to build up the ship&apos;s firepower.</desc>

Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (c) 1996 Nazca.

A scrolling &apos;run-and-gun&apos; platform game for one or two players, Metal Slug is a humorous parody of war and specifically of World War II and the Nazis.

The game features six enemy-packed levels, referred to as &apos;missions&apos;. Players start the game armed only with a pistol, but extra weapons can be picked up and used for greater firepower. Also, at certain points during a level players will find an unused &apos;Super Vehicle-001&apos; - or Metal Slug - tank which can be entered and driven. The Metal Slug is slow-moving but has very powerful weapons. If the Slug takes too many hits it will break down and start to flash, the player must then quickly exit the vehicle before it explodes. The enemy troops also have vehicles at their disposal, such as tanks, boats and helicopters.

The levels are littered with bearded hostages who, when rescued, award players with either points bonuses (in the form of medals) or weapon power-ups. Available weapons are Heavy Machine Gun, Flame Shot, Rocket Launcher and Shotgun. Hand grenades are also available.

Each level ends with at least one large enemy &apos;Boss&apos; vehicle that takes many hits to destroy. Once the boss has been destroyed, bonus points are awarded for each prisoner rescued. Further bonus points are awarded if the player&apos;s Metal Slug vehicle has survived the boss battle.</desc>

Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001/II (c) 1998 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

The heroes of Metal Slug, Marco and Tarma, are called into action once again to take on the might of General Morden and his armies in this, the first of several sequels to the superb 1996 original. This time, however, Morden has acquired a number of powerful allies to aid him in his evil schemes, some of which are not even human. The 2 brave soldiers are called upon to deal with this threat once again, aided by members of the newly founded &apos;Sparrow Squad&apos;, Fio and Eri.

Metal Slug 2 improved on much of what made the first game great; featuring more enemies, larger bosses, more weapons, more vehicles, more hostages, more surprises and more humour than its illustrious predecessor. The occasional moments of slowdown that blighted the first game are still present, however.</desc>

Metal Slug 3 (c) 2000 SNK.

The heroes of the first 2 games return once more to do battle with the ever-present General Morden and his vast army. The third game of the series places a greater emphasis on defeating hulking boss characters than the 2 previous outings. Metal Slug 3 also introduced multiple routes through most levels, vastly increasing the replay value of the game. For example; on the first level the player reaches a point where they can either continue over land, or enter a small submarine and head down into the ocean depths, where they will be faced with a variety of huge, deadly sea-dwelling creatures.

Metal Slug 3 introduced a number of new elements that have a direct effect on the player&apos;s character - similar to the &apos;mummification&apos; of the second game. The first of these is the &apos;fatty&apos; affect: should the player pick up too much food (fish, for example) their character will morph in an obese version of itself. This doesn&apos;t have any detrimental effect on performance and is included purely for reasons of humour. Another effect is the now infamous &apos;Zombiefication&apos;; should the player&apos;s character be attacked by a Zombie, he or she will become Zombie until they are either killed, or pick up a first-aid, which will restore the player&apos;s character back to human form. Movement while in the zombie state is slow and restricted but the player is armed with what can perhaps be best described as the &apos;Zombie Vomit&apos;; a huge arc of blood that can be used to destroy oncoming enemies. A second Zombie attack while the player&apos;s character is in a Zombie state will result in the player losing a life.</desc>

Metal Slug 5 (c) 2003 SNK Playmore.

A research installation developing the next-generation of Metal Slugs is attacked by unknown forces and a disk containing Metal Slug secrets is stolen. Ordered to recover the disk, Marco and Tarma follow in hot pursuit. Meanwhile, Eri and Fio, investigating the Ptolemaic Army, a paramilitary syndicate active in archeological excavation, catch up with them at an ancient ruin, &apos;The Corridor of Fire&apos;. The two try to storm and seize the site but are repulsed by the natives and giant Metal Slugs. This incident proves it was the Ptolemaic Army that stole the Metal Slug secrets. The military subsequently launches a second raid by the elite PF squad and Sparrows on the &apos;The Corridor of Fire&apos; to recover the secrets and destroy the syndicate!!!</desc>

Metal Slug X - Super Vehicle-001 (c) 1999 SNK.

Originally released to improve upon some of the problems the previous Metal Slug game (&quot;Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001/II&quot;) had, most notably its notorious slowdown, this update also implemented several changes to beef up the gameplay, such as new enemies, a different end boss layout and a number of new weapons and secrets. The result is a better game and one of the finest chapters in this series.</desc>

Metro-Cross (c) 1985 Namco.

Metro-Cross is an abstract, horizontally-scrolling single player racing game set in an automated futuristic city. Players take on the role of &apos;The Runner&apos;, who must run through each of the game&apos;s 32 stages to cross the finish line before the time limit expires. If the Runner finishes a round within the time limit, remaining time is converted to bonus points and the next round begins. 

Obstacles that hinder the runner&apos;s progress include &apos;Slip Zones&apos; that slow him down if he tries to run over them, &apos;Pitfalls&apos; that  break under the Runner&apos;s weight and drop him into the holes and &apos;Crackers&apos; that launch the Runner up into the air and cause him to land on his back. Later rounds also feature &apos;Jumbo Tires&apos; that bounce towards the Runner, barriers that emerge from the ground before receding back into it, Cubes that move through particular columns of tiles, Mice that attempt to jump onto the Runner and slow him down and Chess Knights and Kings that bounce from one tile to another. Clinging mice fall off the runner if he leaps from a springboard.

Progress is aided by yellow springboards that hurl the runner forwards at great speed (players must press the fire button while on the springboard) and a skateboard, that is unaffected by the green &apos;Slip Zone&apos; tiles that would otherwise slow the player&apos;s progress. Bonus points can be earned by kicking the static drinks cans that can be found throughout each level.

Every fourth round is special, using the remaining time from the three previous rounds as additional completion time. However, if the Runner has not finished the round before the time limit runs out, he will be electrocuted and the game is immediately over.</desc>

Missile Command (c) 1980 Atari.

Missile Command is a one or two-player game depicting the outbreak of a nuclear war. Players must defend six cities from waves of incoming nuclear missiles by launching their own anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs) from one of three missile batteries. 

The game is played by moving a cross-hair across the sky and pressing one of three buttons to launch an ABM from the corresponding battery (either Alpha Base, Delta Base or Omega Base). Upon reaching the cross-hair the player&apos;s ABM explodes, creating a fireball that lasts for several seconds and destroys any enemy missiles that enter it. Each battery is initially armed with ten anti-ballistic missiles and becomes useless when either all of its missiles have been fired or it&apos;s been destroyed by enemy missiles. 

New enemy weapons are introduced in later levels that increase the level of difficulty; smart bombs that can evade a less than perfectly targeted missile, and bomber planes and satellites that fly across the screen and launch missiles of their own. Missiles from the player&apos;s central battery fly to their targets at much greater speed and are the most effective way of destroying smart bombs from a distance.

Enemy weapons are only able to destroy a maximum of three cities per level. A level ends once all enemy missiles have either been destroyed or have reached their target. At the conclusion of a level, players receive bonus points for any remaining cities and unused missiles. Between levels, missile batteries are rebuilt and replenished, while destroyed cities are only rebuilt at set point thresholds (determined by the game&apos;s dip switch settings).

The game ends once all cities have been destroyed.

- CAST OF ELEMENTS - 

Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABM): The defensive missiles you launch to protect your cities. Each missile base contains 10 ABMs per wave. If any missile base is struck by an attack missile or smart bomb, the remaining stock of ABMs for that wave are destroyed, and the missile base is rendered useless until the next wave. You receive bonus points for every ABM you have remaining at the end of each wave. 

Targeting crosshair: Aim your ABMs quickly but carefully. Use the trackball to move the targeting crosshair to where you want the next ABM to go, then press any Launch Control button to fire the ABM. The ABM will explode where the crosshair was positioned when the Launch Control button was pressed.

Mortal Kombat (c) 1992 Midway.

Mortal Kombat, first in the Mortal Kombat series, is a 1-on-1 fighting game featuring a cast of seven different characters. Mortal Kombat took ideas from Capcom&apos;s seminal Street Fighter II, such as the game&apos;s special moves and projectiles. It also introduced a cast of photo-realistic digitized fighters for players to fight either as or against. 

Mortal Kombat characters list:
JOHNNY CAGE
KANO
RAIDEN
LIU KANG
SCORPION
SUB-ZERO
SONYA BLADE

Battles are fought over the best of three rounds. At the end of a battle, a voice instructs the winner to &apos;Finish Him/Her!&apos; and players have only a couple of seconds to try and execute their character&apos;s &apos;fatality&apos;, which sees the winner killing the loser in a spectacular and grisly fashion.</desc>

Mr. Do&apos;s Wild Ride (c) 1984 Universal.

Mr Do&apos;s third arcade outing is another platform game, following on from the superb &quot;Mr. Do&apos;s Castle&quot;, released a year earlier.

In both &quot;Mr Do!&quot; and &quot;Mr. Do&apos;s Castle&quot;, collecting all of the cherries available was a way of completing a level. In Wild Ride, however, collecting them merely changes the &apos;prize&apos; awarded upon reaching the level&apos;s goal. This can be one or two letters from EXTRA, or other items which simply award bonus points. When Mr. Do reaches his goal, he waves a flag while the bonus counter is added to his score.

The gameplay is similar to that of Nintendo&apos;s legendary &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, with Mr. Do starting each level at the bottom of the screen, trying to make his way to the exit at the very top. Mr. Do doesn&apos;t have either his Powerball or mallet in this game, but holding the ACTION button makes him run faster along the track. The trade-off of this is that his bonus points deplete much quicker. When all of the EXTRA letters are collected, the player is awarded with an extra life.

Each of the game&apos;s six levels is set on a roller coaster, with each having its own theme, traps and pitfalls. Wild Ride doesn&apos;t feature the intermission screens that appear in previous Mr.Do games.

The levels are:
Level 1, Roller Coaster. 
Level 2, Pirate Ship. 
Level 3, Three Elevators. 
Level 4, Castle on Screen. 
Level 5, Multiple Columns. 
Level 6, Six Rings.

After level six the levels are repeated.</desc>

NAM-1975 (c) 1990 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

NAM-1975 is a war themed shoot-em-up set during the final months of the Vietnam war and offers one or simultaneous two-player gameplay. The story begins with the two soldiers called Silver and Brown entering the war to rescue Dr. R. Muckly, an ex-scientist of the US Army who has been kidnapped by the &apos;Northside Terrorists&apos;. Dr. Muckly&apos;s daughter, Nancy, has also been kidnapped and is presumed imprisoned.

As the game progresses it&apos;s revealed that Dr. Muckly is a madman who is building a gigantic laser cannon with which to take over the world, players must fight through enemy-packed stages to reach and defeat the evil scientist. The game is an into-the-screen shoot-em-up with the action viewed from a third-person perspective. Players can move left and right, as well as run and somersault to avoid the incoming enemy fire. 

Players are initially armed with only a standard infinite-ammo machine gun and ten grenades. When certain enemies are killed, however, they drop more powerful guns or grenades that can be collected and used by the players. Weapons that can be picked up are:

* Balcan (A more powerful machine gun)
* Flamethrower (for taking out ground units only)
* Missile Launcher. 
* Grenades
* Spark Bomb
* Napalm Bomb.

Occasionally, an enemy soldier will appear holding a hostage. If players kill the soldier and save the hostage, the hostage joins the player and shoots at enemies until either the player is killed or reaches the end of the stage.

The final battle against Dr. Muckly does not allow continues and if players lose all of their lives during the battle, the game is over.</desc>

Nebulasray (c) 1994 Namco.

NebulasRay is a vertically scrolling shoot&apos;em up for one or two players. Civil war has broken out in the Austral star system, with the militaristic &apos;Master Forces&apos; ousting the ruling government and looking to seize control of the entire system. 

Taking on the role of resistance fighters, players must battle through waves of enemy ships across 6 levels, before finally reaching and destroying the &apos;Master Fortress&apos;. As well as forward-firing weapons, each player ship also carries a limited number of powerful bombs that inflict much greater damage on the enemy than the standard weapons. Initially, each player ship is armed with only 3 bombs. 

Numerous weapons and power-ups can be picked up during play, each of which can itself be powered-up: 
* WIDE SHOT - Increases shot width. 5 levels available. 
* GAIN POWER - Increases destructive power. 5 levels available. 
* SPEED UP - Increases player ship speed. 5 levels available. 
* BOMB - Extra bomb. Maximum of 7 can be carried. 
* FOUR-BARREL PHOTON - Powerful Photon torpedoes. Time-based. 
* HOMING LASER - Powerful lasers that automatically target enemies. Time-based. 
* LIGHTING BURST - Powerful short-range lightning burst. Time-based. 
* DEFLECTOR - Shield to protect player ships. Time-based. 
* EXTRA POINTS - Pick up for 3000 points. 

Visually, NebulasRay employs complex sprite rotation and scaling techniques - as well as multi-layered parallax scrolling - to create impressive and highly detailed graphics with a true sense of depth.</desc>

Neo Drift Out - New Technology (c) 1996 Visco.

Neo Drift Out - New Technology is a rally-themed racing game viewed from an overhead isometric perspective. Players choose to race in one of three Japanese rally-spec vehicles: the Mitsubishi Lancer, the Subaru Impreza and the Toyota Celica, with each car offering a different balance of Speed, Control and Body.

The game consists of a short practice stage, followed by up to six race stages, each set in its own location and offering different driving conditions. To progress to the next race, players must reach the current stage&apos;s finish line within a set time limit. Failure to cross the line in time results in game over. Each stage also featues a mid-way checkpoint that must be reached within a set time.

During a race, on-screen arrows advise players of upcoming corners and bends, and prompts warn them of hazards, these can include patches of ice, rocks, barrels, cones and ramps. Rival drivers also pose a hazard as they can ram into the player&apos;s car, causing it to spin out. Many stages include short-cuts and the six racing stages and their driving surfaces are:

Big Tournament Golf (c) 1996 Nazca Corporation.

Big Tournament Golf is an arcade golf game in which one or two players choose from a selection of six different golfers, each of which has different strengths and weaknesses to their game. This allows players to select a golfer that suits their preferred style of gameplay. 

The six golfers and their attributes are:
* Young Hero (USA) Driving 3 - Accuracy 3 - Skill 3 - Recovery 3 - Putting 3
* Technician (United Kingdom) Driving 2 - Accuracy 4 - Skill 5 - Recovery 4 - Putting 3
* Veteran (Australia) Driving 1 - Accuracy 2 - Skill 4 - Recovery 5 - Putting 2
* Shot Maker (Germany) Driving 4 - Accuracy 5 - Skill 2 - Recovery 2 - Putting 4
* Power Golfer (Brazil) Driving 5 - Accuracy 1 - Skill 1 - Recovery 1 - Putting 1
* Putt Master (Japan) Driving 3 - Accuracy 2 - Skill 4 - Recovery 2 - Putting 5

Players can choose to play on one of four eighteen-hole courses: Germany, Japan, Australia and U.S.A. Two game modes are available: one-player stroke play against the CPU, or stroke or match-play against a second player.

Unlike many golf games of the era that used a two-click swing system to determine the hook or slice of the ball, &quot;Neo Turf Masters&quot; uses a single click for the power of the shot and a second for the height of the shot. Hook and slice are determined before making the shot. 

Big Tournament Golf follows the standard golf scoring system. The order from the best to the worst performance is:
Albatros (3 hits under Par)
Eagle (2 hits under Par)
Birdie (1 hit under Par)
Par (reach the par for the hole)
Bogey (1 hit over Par)
Double Bogey (2 hits over Par)
Triple Bogey (3 hits over Par)

If players miss the attempt to make a Triple Bogey, they will have to give up the hole and will suffer an additional penalty. If the ball lands out of bounds or in the water, the player will be penalized one stroke.

* Contests are sometimes announced at the start of a hole:

1) The closest to the pin contest: players must hit the ball as close as possible to the pin when driving off. If their ball gets closer to the pin than the previous record, they will earn a bonus hole.

2) The longest driving contest: players must drive the ball as far as possible. If they exceed the previous record, they will earn a bonus hole.</desc>

New Rally-X (c) 1981 Namco.

New Rally-X is a scrolling, overhead mazed-based racing game in which the player drives a racing car around a maze and must collect ten yellow flags before the car&apos;s fuel runs out. In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that pursue and try to ram into and destroy the player&apos;s car. The enemy cars are faster moving than the player&apos;s vehicle. 

The player&apos;s car automatically moves in whichever direction the joystick is pushed and if it runs into a wall, it will turn automatically and continue moving. To disrupt the chasing enemy cars a smoke-screen can be activated that trails behind the player&apos;s car, causing any pursuing vehicles to crash. Activating the smoke screen uses a small amount of fuel, however, so players must be careful to not overuse it.

Each maze also has rock formations and crashing into these will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right-hand side of the playing area shows the relative positions of the flags, rocks and enemy vehicles. 

In addition to the standard ten flags, each maze also contains a special flag (indicated by the letter &quot;S&quot;). If collected, the value earned for the round&apos;s remaining flags doubles from 100 to 200 points. If the player dies before the end of that round, the flag value is set back to 100 points and the double bonus is lost. 

The mazes also contain a &apos;lucky flag&apos;. This is marked with the letter &apos;L&apos; and - providing there are still standard flags remaining - awards the player extra points for remaining fuel, after which the round will continue as normal. Upon completion of a round, bonus points are awarded based on how much fuel the player has remaining.

As players progress through the rounds, the number or pursuing enemy cars increases.</desc>

The New Zealand Story (c) 1988 Taito Corp.

Set in Antipodean country of the game&apos;s title, The New Zealand Story is an eight-way scrolling platform game featuring Tiki the Kiwi bird. Tiki and his friends have been kidnapped by the evil &apos;Wally&apos;, a large blue leopard seal who wants the birds for his next meal. Tiki quickly escapes and sets about rescuing his trapped friends.  

The game&apos;s stages are made up of platforms with a caged kiwi bird awaiting rescue at the end of each. Touching the cage releases the trapped Kiwi and an open window appears, indicating the completion of the stage. 

Tiki starts the game armed with a bow and arrows, but weapon pick-ups can be found including bombs, a laser gun and bouncing fireballs. Tiki must jump between platforms, with the length of the button press dictating the strength of the jump. Some platforms have spikes and barbed plants are also scattered throughout the stages. Any contact with these results in the loss of a player life.

During his quest Tiki can commandeer a variety of different vehicles, including balloons, blimps and UFOs. Vehicles can be found ready for use or can be stolen from an enemy. When using a vehicle, the jump button must either by tapped repeatedly or held down to keep it afloat (the method being dictated by the vehicle used). 

Some stages feature underwater sections; as soon as Tiki drops into water, he is suddenly wearing a snorkel. As he swims his oxygen level - indicated by a meter - gradually decreases. Before the air runs out Tiki must either jump out of the water, or find an air pocket to replenish his oxygen. 

The game features four main zones, each consisting of four rounds. A boss fight occurs at the end of each zone. The complex level design rewards exploration, with bonus items and alternate routes to be found, as well as secret level warps that transport the player to a later level. The warps are invisible until shot several times by the player (see &apos;TIPS AND TRICKS&apos; for more details).</desc>

Omega Fighter (c) 1989 UPL.

While similar to most vertical scrolling shooters, Omega Fighter is unique in its gameplay, level and enemy focus: rather than flying through multiple levels, the player faces an enormous space battle cruiser which contains every level.

There are two weapons that the player picks up, and if the player picks up a different powerup, it will always reset to its lowest level:
(I) - Ion Laser: Shoots straight, pick up more to increase damage at a cost of decreasing length. Ideal for close combat.
(W) - Wide Shot: Shoots bullets in wider range when collecting more of them. Ideal for taking enemies from afar but deals less damage.

There are also two items that are pressed by the bomb button, and players may pick up to two of them:
Silver - Activate to slow down everything on screen. Useful to dodge bullets and getting closer for higher score.
Gold - Destroy all enemies on screen, score depends on closeness to player prior to using the item.</desc>

Omega Race (c) 1981 Midway

Omega Race is a vector-based single-screen shoot-em-up set in the year 2003, in which the Omegan system has developed a way of training its warriors to protect their star colonies against invading alien androids. Players must pilot an Omegan Space Fighter to engage and destroy the aliens and the mines they have planted. 

The Omegan Fighter can rotate through 360 degrees and thrust to move forwards, it&apos;s also armed with forward-firing lasers with which to shoot the enemy ships. Battles take place in an enclosed area and when the player&apos;s ship reaches the edge of the screen it bounces off an invisible barrier, although the barrier briefly appears when hit or shot. 

As well as firing lasers at the player, some enemy ships also drop mines that must be shot or avoided. As players progress through the waves, the number of enemy attackers and their aggression increases.</desc>

The Outfoxies (c) 1995 Namco.

A platform &apos;versus&apos; shoot&apos;em up in which either one player (playing against the computer) or two players (playing against each other) attempt to destroy each other by any means necessary. The levels themselves are interesting and varied, with airships, planes etc. providing a detailed and highly interactive backdrop in which the players do battle. That interactivity is increased further with the introduction of destructible sections which, when blown up, can often open up new areas or rooms. Each level is littered with a variety of weapons that can be picked up and utilized by the player(s). Graphically, Outfoxies employed superb sprite scale and rotation techniques that elevated the already fun gameplay still further. The aeroplane level, for instance, dips and sways, bringing problems of inertia and gravity to the platform action. Also; the in-game camera zooms in and out of the level, depending on how far away the two opponents are from each other. Playable characters range from a monkey to a pair of psychotic school children, with each character choice offering the player different aptitudes (the monkey can jump higher, for example). A fun enough game in one-player mode, Outfoxies really came into its own when two human protagonists took part.</desc>

Parodius Da! Shinwa kara Owarai e (c) 1990 Konami.

Parodius Da! is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the Great Octopus has threatened Earth. To help Parodius save the planet, the player and his friends must begin their search across the world to find the enemy and destroy him.   

Parodius Da! was created as a parody of Konami&apos;s own &quot;Gradius&quot; series of shoot-em-ups but adopted a graphical style that was entirely its own; something that becomes evident at the very start of the game when players can chose to pilot either a penguin or an octopus rather that the traditional Gradius ship. 

Parodius retains the selectable weapons system of &quot;Gradius&quot;;  a &apos;power meter&apos; at the bottom of the screen enables players to &apos;buy&apos; weapons and upgrades using capsules left behind by certain destroyed enemies. Each collected capsule advances the power meter by one step. Players can activate the highlighted item at any point, after which the power meter resets. For this game, players can also choose to have weapons update automatically, with the game upgrading weapons simply by collecting the capsules.

Parodius Da! also allows players to pilot any one of four different characters: Vic Viper (from Gradius/Nemesis), Octopus, TwinBee and Pentarou. Another new addition is that of bell power-ups. These originally appeared in Konami&apos;s &quot;TwinBee&quot; series and act as one-time power-ups, allowing the player to destroy every enemy on screen, for example, or fire huge energy beams. 

Enemies and environments from the Gradius games and TwinBee are mixed in along with a host of anime-style opponents, including scantily-clad women. Parodius&apos; eccentricity and unique humour is further demonstrated soon after the game begins; as players face such enemies as a giant belly-dancing woman and a half-cat/half-boat creature.</desc>

Penguin Brothers (c) 2000 Subsino.

A multi-screen platform game in which one or two players (either co-operatively or competitively) control a cute penguin fighting against the game&apos;s equally cute enemies. The idea is to destroy all of the on-screen enemies; once this a done, a circular key will appear; the player must pick the key up, whereupon they will be teleported to another screen which represents the second part of the stage. This screen has a silver doorway; the player must carry the key to the door - avoiding or destroying the on-screen enemies - to complete the level.

Playing as a loose cross between Taito&apos;s &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; and Irem&apos;s &quot;Bomber Man&quot;, each player&apos;s penguin is armed with bombs which are used to destroy the game&apos;s enemies, as well as obstructions - such as walls etc. - and barrels; the latter often revealing hidden bonuses that can be collected. Players must be careful to avoid blowing themselves and each other up when the bombs detonate.

Each level contains one or more &apos;rotating&apos; platforms, allowing travel between upper and lower platforms. Players and enemies can stick to the underside of a rotating platform, then rotate it through 180 degrees to reach the platform above them. The opposite applies to reach a lower platform.</desc>

Pirate Pete (c) 1982 Taito America Corporation.

Pirate Pete is a reworked version of &quot;Jungle King&quot;. Here&apos;s what makes Pirate Pete different from Jungle King: 
* An opening musical theme is used in certain parts of the game instead of the opening Tarzan yell (unlike in &quot;Jungle Hunt&quot;, it is NOT the same one used at the end of the ocean stage). 
* The player character is a heroic pirate instead of the Tarzan character.
* In the first stage, the player swings on ropes between ship&apos;s masts instead of vines between trees.
* The second stage is set in an ocean infested with sharks, instead of a river infested with alligators and crocodiles. 
* The third stage adds a new enemy - snakes. They appear at the top of the screen and will kill the player if he touches them while jumping. 
* The enemies in the fourth stage are sword-wielding pirates instead of spear-chucking cannibals.</desc>

Pirate Treasure (c) 1982 Tong Electronic.

The player uses the joystick to move the red pirate ship across the islands to score points: small islands (25 points), medium islands (100 points), big islands (150 points), and great big islands (250 points). Avoid colliding with the black enemy pirate ship and be aware that this ship can also create a live volcano on one of the islands you raided. If you run into a volcano, your ship will explode.

Try to capture the treasure chest when you see it on one of the islands but sometimes the enemy ship will take it and move it onto another island. Your ship can sometimes move through the top, bottom and sides of the screen but at other times the edges of the screen will be blocked by red lines. Everytime you capture one of the treasures, depending on what stage you are on, the prize can be worth from 1000 to 7000 points plus a bonus for every island you raid after you have captured the treasure.

There are seven different stages where you must steal a treasure from one of the infamous pirates including Captain Hook, Captain Kidd, Blackbeard, Long John Silver, Jolly Roger, Pegleg Pete, and The Mad Hackers. After all seven treasures have been captured, there is an intermission where an eye-patched skull and crossbones winks and grins and it says &quot;Yar! Har! Har! Har! Dead Men Tell No Tales!&quot; After that, the stages start all over again, but with increased difficulty. You have three ships at the beginning of the game and you are rewarded an extra ship at 90,000 points.</desc>

The Gougetsuji clan of Kurokos had finally found a new master after Otane Gougetsuji finally defeated the former leader, her older sister Oume. Unfortunately Otane has now disappeared! So a new tournament is called out in order to quickly find a new clan leader. All the fighters from the first tournament have returned as well as some eager (... and strange!) newcomers. Featuring some of the funniest parodies of famous fighting games, a cool soundtrack an tons of new moves making it a way better game than its predecessor, there is no doubt that only the strongest will survive this battle!</desc>

Pretty Soldier Sailormoon (c) 1995 Banpresto.

A 1 or 2-player sideways scrolling beat-em-up sees the Sailor Senshi fighting their way through five levels of anime-based combat. Each Sailor Soldier - chosen from a selection of 5, stiletto and mini skirt-wearing combatants - can punch, kick, jump, and throw their enemies; before finally reaching the traditional end-of-level boss.

As with Capcom&apos;s &quot;Final Fight&quot;, and indeed many other games of the genre, items that aid the player are either dropped by beaten enemies or revealed after hitting certain obstacles and containers. Food can be used to replenish lost health and various trinkets can be picked up for bonus points. Finally, magic crystals can be found and are needed to activate the &apos;special attack&apos; move. This works in a similar way to Sega&apos;s &quot;Shinobi&quot;, with every enemy on the screen taking a hit.

Players must have at least one crystal to use the Special attack and up to 5 crystals can be carried at once. The more crystals the player holds when the special attack is utilized, the more effective it is against the game&apos;s enemies. Each level features its own unique, anime style animation. On level five, Sailor Soldier&apos;s signature attack move, from the original Japanese anime upon which the game is based, makes an appearance.</desc>

PuLiRuLa (c) 1991 Taito Corporation.

PuLiRuLa is a six-level, sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players that defies any logic in either its theme or its graphical approach; that places the players in a dream-like world populated by armies of strange and bizarre creatures. 

PuLiRuLa&apos;s plot centres around the world of &apos;Radishland&apos;. Each of Radishland&apos;s six towns is kept running smoothly with the aid of a giant key, which is necessary to keep the world&apos;s &apos;time-flow&apos; moving. The key is stolen by a mysterious enemy and the timeflow is disrupted. Players must fight their way through waves of increasingly abstract enemies in their quest to recover the key and restore time to Radishland. 

To aid players in their quest, they are each armed with a magical stick, with which they can hit and defeat the game&apos;s abstract enemies. Players are also armed with a limited number of smart bombs, capable of killing multiple enemies. The smart bombs are as visually unique as the rest of the game; taking the form of such things as a herd of running animals, a purple dancing blob-like man or a man in a giant microwave oven who captures and cooks any on-screen enemies. When killed, the enemies disappear and an animal or townsperson is released from inside the creature.</desc>

Pulstar (c) 1995 Aicom.

Pulstar is a sideways scrolling shoot-em-up set in the year 2248, in which the first recorded sign of alien life is discovered on Mars. A signal emanates from the red planet and from it an object is observed travelling at light-speed out of the Solar System. Earth scientists are wary of what this could mean and warn the world&apos;s defenses to prepare for a possible attack.

Eight years later, an alien fleet follows the signal and begins attacking the human space craft awaiting them in Neptune&apos;s orbit. The battle spreads throughout the Solar System and within two years Neptune is destroyed, Jupiter is turned into a star and more than half of Earth&apos;s continents disappear from rising ocean levels and the planet&apos;s changing axis as a result. Kaoru Yamazaki, lone fighter pilot of the Dino246, is one of the few survivors of the Pulstar attack force, founded to save the Solar System from the alien invaders.

Pulstar borrows many of its visual and gameplay elements from all three games in Irem&apos;s legendary &quot;R-Type&quot; series, including the Beam weapon and R-type&apos;s infamous pod attachment. Unlike &quot;R-Type&quot;, however, Pulstar&apos;s pod cannot be detached from the front of the ship and merely acts as a shield to protect the player&apos;s ship.

The game includes a weapon power bar which consists of two halves. The right-hand side of the bar turns blue when the fire button is held down and when released, it delivers a devastating beam of energy. The left-hand side turns red when the fire button is pressed repeatedly in quick succession, shooting out a barrage of smaller, rapid blasts.

Pulstar consists of eight challenging levels, with the player able to start the game on any one of the first four.</desc>

R*Type (c) 1987 Irem Corp.

R*Type is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the evil Bydo Empire rules the galaxy through fear and intimidation and it&apos;s up to the player - piloting their heavily-armed R-9 space ship - to battle through eight tough levels to the heart of the Bydo stronghold and defeat them.

The game&apos;s revolutionary weapons system is its real stroke of genius. The first of numerous innovations that R*Type bought to the genre is the beam weapon: when the fire button is held down, a &apos;power meter&apos; starts to charge up; once the meter is full, releasing the fire button unleashes a very powerful plasma burst capable of inflicting much greater damage to enemy ships or even destroying numerous enemies simultaneously. The trade-off is that charging the weapon takes up valuable seconds, giving the Bydo ships time to attack.

The most significant addition to R-type&apos;s arsenal is the now-legendary &apos;Force Pod&apos;. This takes the form of an invincible, detachable laser-firing pod that can be attached to either the front or rear of the player&apos;s ship, or can be detached completely, after which the pod sits some distance either ahead or behind the player&apos;s ship, tracking its movements and providing additional fire power. When attached to the R9 ship, the pod acts as a shield. This forms a crucial part of R*Type&apos;s gameplay and has to be fully utilised to navigate certain sections of the game, such as the huge mothership that comprises the game&apos;s 3rd stage.

R*Type&apos;s levels are designed to make full use of its unique weapons system, making for very linear and demanding gameplay in which losing or picking up the wrong weapon at the wrong time often leads to an instant death. Its intelligent, precise and demanding level design, gave the world its first truly &apos;strategic&apos; shoot-em-up.</desc>

R*Type II (c) 1989 Irem.

The sequel to the hugely successful original finds the evil Bydo Empire once again intent on the destruction of all mankind in this sideways scrolling, six-level shoot-em-up.

The innovative weapons system of the original game - the &apos;Beam Weapon&apos; and &apos;Force Pod&apos; - make a welcome return and remain unchanged for the sequel.

The tight, demanding gameplay and high emphasis on correct usage of the weapons system also return - although the sequel is, if anything, even more demanding than its already unforgiving predecessor; with more durable enemies and trickier level design. 

R*Type II features three new weapon shot types: 
* Green - Search Laser - fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 45° angles. 
* Grey - Shotgun Laser - fires large shells that travel a short distance before exploding powerfully. 
* Scatter Bomb - drops bombs to the ground; when these explode, the explosion scatters forwards along the ground. This is a supporting weapon that can be equipped instead of missiles.

In addition to the new weapons, R-type II&apos;s Beam Weapon has received an upgrade. As with the first game, holding down the fire button makes a power gauge fill up, releases the button then unleashes a powerful plasma shot. For the sequel, however, continuing to hold down the button causes the gauge to charge up further. This &apos;double-charged&apos; gauge flashes blue and red and releases an even more powerful plasma burst.</desc>

R*Type Leo (c) 1992 Irem.

R-Type Leo is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up and is the third and final arcade release of this classic series (although numerous console-only sequels would follow, see &apos;Series&apos; for details).

Mankind are currently at peace with their former adversaries, the Bydo Empire, and have taken the opportunity to undertake a massive project called &apos;Project Paradise&apos;. This involved the construction of an artificial terrestrial-like planet called &apos;Eden&apos;, created as a safe haven should humanity once again find itself under threat. However, soon after construction is completed, &apos;Major&apos; - the bio-computer system responsible for maintaining Eden - malfunctions, taking control of the planet&apos;s defences and launching an attack on mankind. It is up to the newly-developed &apos;R-9 Leo&apos; fleet to fly in and stop Major&apos;s assault on its creators.

R-Type Leo deviates from the gameplay style of its predecessors by removing the use of both the &apos;Force Pod&apos; and the &apos;Wave Cannon&apos;. The new weapons are called &apos;Force Bits&apos; (later identified in &quot;R-Type Final&quot; as &quot;Psy Bits&quot;) and the &apos;Bit Shot&apos;. The three &apos;Force Bit&apos; weapon types are:
* Red - Claw Laser: a powerful horizontal laser beam and horizontal traverse wave
* Blue - Mirror Laser: fires multiple, ricocheting lasers.
* Green - Search Laser LRG: fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 90 degree angles.

Unlike previous &apos;Bit&apos; devices, the &apos;Force/Psy Bits&apos; are capable of firing either forwards or backwards (their direction dictated by the movement of the ship itself). Finally, the &apos;Wave Cannon&apos; is replaced by a &apos;Bit Shot&apos;, in which the Psy Bits detach from the ship and collide with the nearest enemy. The Bits can only do this for a limited time before running out of energy, and must be recalled to the ship to recharge.

R Type Leo consists of 6 stages and is the first game in the series to allow 2 players to play simultaneously.</desc>

Radical Radial (c) 1982 Nichibutsu.

This is an interesting take on the shooter genre, with three unique sections in each stage. You control a tire with the ability to jump and shoot. When you jump, you can only be hit by the enemies in the first stage.

In the first level, you need to dodge or jump over rocks as bat-like enemies rush down the screen, weaving across it. Occasionally a string of enemies will appear that give a bonus of 1000 if you hit them all. You can also pick up bonus items worth 300 points each.

In the second level, you are driving down a busy road. You need to doge cars as they erratically move across the screen. Occasionally an ambulance will drive up the screen, and if it hits a vehicle it will go flying across the screen. Watch out for the blue trucks in this section. Midway through this part, a green truck appears which drops stars. They are worth 500 each. There are broken down vehicles on the road, along with oil slicks. The pickups worth 300 points make a return.

The third level is a bonus round. You continue driving down the road, but now there are only oil slicks. You need to collect as many point pickups as possible. If you die in this section, it jumps to the next level, and you do not lose a life. You get a bonus if you get every pickup. You are then given a bonus based on your time for the last stage.

There is a difficulty spike at the third stage. The extra life is at 50000. You only get one extra life during the course of the game. The game is infinite.</desc>

Reactor (c) 1982 Gottlieb.

The player controls a cursor that can move freely within a screen-sized arena, the nuclear reactor. The center contains a sun-type gravitational power source, the slowly overheating reactor core. The surrounding wall or the sun, if touched results in death. The cursor is controlled with a trackball by the player, who has to roll it fast in one direction in order to overcome the momentum of gravitation imposed by the sun. Swarms of enemy objects named after various radioactive particles float around in the reactor arena, obeying simple physical laws. These enemies can freely bounce into the walls at low speeds, have a repulsive force against each other and actively attack the player cursor. Boss types often break up into several smaller particles.

The object is to survive the sun and walls while gaining the highest score possible. It takes a delicate touch. Rather than moving the cursor/avatar left, right, up and down as in many arcade games, it is controlled by gravity and moves freely; with the player only being able to accelerate it rather than control its movements directly. Meanwhile the enemy particles are getting so aggressive that it can get very difficult to avoid being pulled in by the sun or touching a wall.

The basic gameplay consists of accelerating the cursor just at the right times so that it circles the reactor core with enough speed to have control via its own momentum when the enemy particles try to knock it off course, and then to place decoys and actually use the acceleration of the ball itself to knock enemies into control rods, traps or the reactor core. By pressing the primary button the player cursor can go into high power mode, providing higher repulsion of enemies and conversely higher risk to the player.

To ease the task the player also has a certain number of decoys at their disposal. Pressing the secondary button places a decoy to attract the enemies, luring them into two traps in the corners of the screen for bonus points, into destroying reactor rods or directly into the walls to kill them. Destroying a row of reactor rods gives the player one more decoy, as well as resetting the size of the slowly swelling reactor core.

A time limit is enforced by the slowly swelling reactor core, which limits the space to move about in the arena. Although the reactor doesn&apos;t actually melt down, the decreasing space provides for gradually increasing difficulty. After d</desc>

Renegade (c) 1986 Taito America Corp.

Western version of &quot;Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun [Model TA-0018]&quot;. The game&apos;s graphics were redrawn for the game&apos;s localization as Renegade to the game&apos;s characters and settings a western feel. The plot was also changed from beating up numerous gangs who are bullying the main character&apos;s best friend to rescuing the main character&apos;s girlfriend. Kunio, the main character in the Japanese, would return in numerous games including &quot;Nekketsu Koukou Dodgeball-bu&quot;, the Japanese version of &quot;Super Dodge Ball&quot;, some which underwent a similar localization process when they were released in the west (such as the NES game River City Ransom).

- TRIVIA -

Renegade was released in December 1986.

Rezon (c) 1991 Allumer, Limited.

A reasonably playable, if wholly unremarkable sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up that unashamedly rips off Irem&apos;s legendary &quot;R*Type&quot;. Unfortunately, Rezon lacks any of R*Type&apos;s innovations in either level design or the weapons available to the player. One attribute it does share with the Irem classic, however, is that it is extremely difficult.</desc>

Ribbit! (c) 1991 Sega.

Ribbit! is a one or co-operative two-player action game and is an unofficial sequel to Konami&apos;s seminal 1981 release, &quot;Frogger&quot;. Unlike its legendary prequel, in which players had to guide a frog to its home at top of each screen without being killed, the aim here is to eat a set number of benign creatures, including Ants and Dragon-flies, while avoiding harmful creatures, including spiders and mice. 

Ribbit&apos;s stages take place over a number of different locations, with the location changing every third round. Different environments include a beach, a factory and, in tribute to the original game, a fast flowing river with logs and turtles acting as platforms. Each stage must be cleared of all benign creatures within a set time limit, with bonus points awarded if completed within 60 seconds. The amount earned is determined by how quickly the stage is completed. 

While some locations have harmful creatures as the main challenge, for others the environment itself is the danger. On the beach stage, for example, players must avoid the incoming tide, while the factory stage features fast-moving conveyer belts and machine presses. Advice, in the form of a short poem, is given at the start of each location, warning of the location&apos;s dangers and how to navigate them.

A bonus round appears after every third stage, in which players must run over as many of either flowers or mushrooms as possible to make them bloom. Including the bonus rounds, &quot;Ribbit&quot; features over fifty stages of play.</desc>

Riot City (c) 1991 Sega.

Riot City is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players who take on the roles of &apos;Paul&apos; or &apos;Bobby&apos;, two talented fighters who are given the task of breaking a drug syndicate known as &quot;MID&quot;. It has also been discovered that Paul&apos;s girlfriend has been kidnapped by the syndicate and must be rescued.

MID&apos;s hideout is located on Riot Island, an island full of abandoned, run-down buildings that has since become a slum. Locations include apartments, a hospital, a factory and a casino.

Riot City is practically a direct copy of Capcom&apos;s superb &apos;Final Fight&apos;, with both gameplay and graphical style heavily copied from the 1989 classic. One gameplay difference is that Riot City does not allow players to pick up and use weapons as they can in Final Fight, although bonus items found in various containers can be collected.</desc>

Robo Army (c) 1991 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku]. 

Robo Army is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players who take on the roles of two cybernetically-enhanced soldiers called Rocky and Maxima and must attempt to stop am invading cyber army called &apos;Hell Jeed&apos; from enslaving the human race.

The game uses three buttons: 
A - Attack
B - Jump
C - Energy blast

Hitting the jump and attack button simultaneously lets Rocky and Maxima attack behind them. Collecting energy balls makes the energy blast more powerful, similar to the magic potions in Sega&apos;s &quot;Golden Axe&quot;. One major difference, however, is that the special attack here can be used several times to diminishing effect before it finally runs out.

Players can often pick up a fallen robot&apos;s limb to club other robots to death with. Also, if players approach a weakened enemy and press forward and the A button at the right time, Maxima or Rocky will rip the enemy in half.

Finally, a defeated enemy will occasionally drop a glowing icon of a human fist. Picking this up causes Rocky or Maxima to bend over and transform into a futuristic buggy-like vehicle. Any enemies Maxima and Rocky touch while in buggy form instantly explode while hitting the attack button allows them to speed across the screen to quickly run enemies down. The buggy only lasts for a limited time, however.</desc>

RoboCop - The Future of Law Enforcement (c) 1988 Data East.

RoboCop is a single player horizontally-scrolling platform shoot-em-up based on the 1987 movie of the same name. The game&apos;s story mirrors that of the film, with former city cop Murphy, now a half-human cyborg called &apos;RoboCop&apos;, on a mission to bring down the evil OCP corporation that created him.

The game features nine levels of action. Seven of these are platform-based stages that comprise the main game, with the additional two stages being into-the-screen target ranges. The ranges are effectively bonus stages, in which players accrue points by shooting as many targets as possible within a time limit. Additional player health is then awarded depending on the amount of points earned.

In the platform-based stages, wooden crates and barrels occasionally bar RoboCop&apos;s progress, these can be punched to remove them. Robocop is armed with an infinite-ammo machine pistol, but one of three weapon upgrades can be found hidden inside marked wooden crates (or occasionally dropped by defeated enemies). The three possible upgrades are; Three-way Gun, Dual Laser or the incredibly powerful Cobra Gun. The power-ups have only a limited number of shots, however, with remaining shots displayed in the upper-right corner of the screen.

As well as weapons, small jars of baby food can also be found (again, mirroring the movie) that when picked up, will restore some of Robocop&apos;s health.

During the game, Robocop will occasionally come across a criminal holding a girl hostage. He must kill the criminal without killing the hostage, otherwise some of Robocop&apos;s health is lost. The criminal will periodically duck while firing, Robocop must also duck but to avoid killing the hostage, must only shoot while the criminal is ducking. 

The film&apos;s incidental music plays throughout the game and RoboCop&apos;s speech is sampled directly from the original film.</desc>

Rod-Land (c) 1990 Jaleco.

Rod-Land is a cute and colourful platform game for one or two players in which two fairy sisters - &apos;Tam&apos; and &apos;Rit&apos; - must rescue their kidnapped mother from the &apos;Maboots Tower&apos; fortress.

The fairies are armed with the &apos;Rods of Sheesanomo&apos; - two magical rods that enable the fairies to catch enemies in a force-field and slam them into the platforms to kill them - and must clear each level of enemies to move onto the next and eventually reach and infiltrate the Tower.

As well as the magical rods used for attacking enemies, the fairies can also create a magical ladder - in a fashion very similar to that used in Taito&apos;s &quot;Rainbow islands&quot; - which can be utilised anywhere on a level and allows players to reach other platforms or escape from pursuing enemies. Each player can utilise only one magically-created ladder at any one time and the creation of a new ladder removes the previously-created one.

A level is only completed when all enemies have been killed. Some defeated enemies drop bonus items, such as fruit, missiles and bombs.

Each of the game&apos;s levels features brightly coloured flowers. If players manage to collect all of these, the &apos;Extra Game&apos; mode begins. During this time-limited mode all of the level&apos;s enemies turn red and move much faster. If the enemies are killed in time, they drop an alphabetic letter that can be collected to spell the word &apos;EXTRA&apos; and earn players an extra life.</desc>

A straight sequel to the superb 1986 original, Rolling Thunder 2 sees one or two players taking control of secret agents in this scrolling, platform shoot-em-up. The agents once again find themselves up against the sinister GERDRA organization and its many armed agents. Gameplay is very similar to the original, with doors both releasing enemies and hiding weapons and ammunition for the players to collect.

Rolling Thunder 2 improves on its illustrious predecessor in a number of ways; the most obvious one being the vastly improved and incredibly colourful graphics. The most striking improvement, however, is the addition of a simultaneous, co-operative two player mode; which adds immeasurably to the game&apos;s appeal. For the sequel, the one player agent is a woman, with a second player taking the role of a male agent.</desc>

Rough Racer (c) 1990 Sega.

A colourful top-down racing game for one to four players; Rough Racer takes most of its inspiration from Atari&apos;s &quot;Sprint&quot; series, and from &quot;Championship&quot; and &quot;Super Sprint&quot; in particular.

The game features ten different tracks, each with its own graphical theme. After the first race, in addition to the four racing cars a fifth &apos;drone&apos; vehicle is added, whose sole intention is to hinder the four racers. The drone is visibly different from the racers and can be anything from a steam roller to a cement mixer.

To qualify for the next race, players must initially finish within the top three places. In later levels, progression can only be made by finishing in first place. A qualifying place will earn the player money which can be used at a between-stage garage to upgrade the player&apos;s car. Tires and armour can be upgraded, as well as filling the car&apos;s engine with &apos;nitro&apos; fluid. When used in-race, this gives the player&apos;s car a temporary speed boost, although this is at the expense of control.</desc>

Rygar - Legendary Warrior (c) 1986 Tecmo.

Export release. Game developed in Japan. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese release entry; &quot;Argos no Senshi - Legendary Warrior&quot;.

- TRIVIA -

Rygar was released in May 1986.

The differences between the US and Japanese (Argus no Senshi) are:
* The demo sequences are different.
* The Japanese version seems to have more hidden powers, stars and an extra free life.
* The US version is more biased towards stars and explosions.

- UPDATES -

The differences between the US (set 1) and US (set 2) are:
* &apos;Set 2&apos; has a bug in the code which lets p2 start a game when p1 is already playing. You need to set a dip-switch to enable this behavior (it is usually on by default). If you press &apos;2&apos; while p1 is playing a single player game, &apos;Set 2&apos; will check that you have 1 or more credit before it registers that you&apos;re now in a 2 player game, but it won&apos;t deduct the credit. That&apos;s a bad bug and probably accounts for why a bug-fix version was released.
* In &apos;Set 2&apos;, if p2 starts while p1 is already playing, it says &apos;playre2&apos; instead of &apos;player2&apos; at the top right.
* The first screen of &apos;Set 2&apos; says &apos;ALL RIGHT RESERVED&apos; - missing an &apos;S&apos; - that&apos;s fixed in &apos;Set 1&apos;

Safari (c) 1977 Gremlin.

This game was in black and white, not greyscale (like many early games used), but just 2 colors, black and white. But the characters and animals were large, and very detailed for just using a single color. There were 4 different animals that you could hunt. Snakes and lions were both rather slow moving, and good for 100 points each. Wild boars would run quickly across the screen, but would net you 200 for a kill. Finally, vultures were small and would move around erratically near the top of the screen (being worth 300 points if you could hit them). Touching any of the beasties meant instant death, but it mattered little, because this game played on time limits anyway. Death only meant that you would lose a few seconds waiting for your intrepid big game hunter to reappear (the game lasted 90 seconds total).</desc>

Saint Dragon (c) 1989 Jaleco.

Saint Dragon is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the galaxy is under threat from a malevolent race of cyborgs. Half animal, half machine, the cyborgs have already conquered most of the galaxy and now have their sights set on the galaxy&apos;s last hope, &apos;The Planet of the Golden Dragon&apos;. A lone mechanoid dragon, unhappy with the actions of his comrades, rebels and sets out to thwart their invasion.

The Dragon is initially armed with a plasma bolts and fiery breath but tokens - resembling bronze-coloured eggs - can be shot to release power-ups to upgrade the dragon&apos;s firepower, offering either pulse torpedoes, a laser, bouncing bombs, ring lasers or a turret. 

Other tokens can upgrade the dragon&apos;s speed or initiate a hyper mode which temporarily gives the dragon maximum firepower and invulnerability. As well as the weapons, the dragon also has an armoured tail which follows the player&apos;s movement, allowing it to be used as a defensive shield.

The game consists of six stages, each culminating in a battle with a large end-of-level guardian.</desc>

Salamander (c) 1986 Konami.

Salamander is a 1 or 2 player sequel to 1985&apos;s superb shoot-em-up, &quot;Nemesis&quot;. While it retained the same basic gameplay and feel of its predecessor (particularly the superb and innovative weapons system), Salamander featured both superior graphics and a more imaginative approach to level design. The earliest example of the latter appears towards the end of the very first level, in which imposing, organic obstructions grow before the players&apos; eyes. The game&apos;s third level - the infamous &apos;lava&apos; level - is another good example of Salamander&apos;s superb design; with huge solar flares constantly erupting both above and below the player&apos;s ship that must be carefully navigated to avoid instant loss of life. Salamander introduced further variety to the action with the introduction vertically-scrolling levels, which alternated with the standard side-scrolling levels.

Salamander&apos;s weapon power-up system is as follows:
* SPEED UP: Five speed levels.
* MISSILE: Press missile button to launch.
* LASER: Your forward rockets turn into deadly lasers.
* RIPPLE LASER: Use shoot button to fire.
* FORCE FIELD: Protect your ship with barriers.
* MULTIPLE: Increase your fire power by up to four times.

Multiple special powers can be obtained, but the LASER cannot be used in conjunction with the RIPPLE Laser.</desc>

真 SAMURAI SPIRITS 覇王丸地獄変 (c) 1994 SNK Corporation.
(Shin Samurai Spirits - Haohmaru Jigoku Hen)

Shin Samurai Spirits is a one-on-one fighting game featuring 15 weapon-wielding combatants, fighting to earn the right to face the game&apos;s powerful and difficult end boss.

Building upon the success of the first game, SNK added several new characters and more moves. This is particularly evident in the addition of the POW meter, which acts as a super special-move meter. These moves not only cause severe damage to opponents but also break their weapons, forcing them to fight unarmed for a short time before a replacement weapon is issued.

Gameplay was further expanded to include several new movement options, including the ability to roll forwards and backwards, to duck to avoid high attacks, or to do small hops to avoid low strikes. This was also the first game to incorporate an offensive blocking technique, or &apos;parry&apos;. Via a command issued at the last second, players can deflect an incoming attack and leave their adversary open to counter-attack. 

Shin Samurai Spirits featured cameo appearances from other SNK characters, as well as a hidden boss who would occasionally come out to challenge players.</desc>

Samurai Shodown IV - Amakusa&apos;s Revenge (c) 1996 SNK.

The 4th installment of the weapons-based one-on-one fighting series features seventeen selectable characters and two end bosses. Changes to the established formula include the removal of both aerial blocking and the switch-around move (the latter of which which allowed a player to move quickly behind their opponent&apos;s back). Dodges, which allowed players to evade/side-step attacks are also gone.

Players can no longer charge up their own POW gauge but a new move called the &apos;CD combo&apos; was added; players can press the C and D buttons together, triggering a strike that can be followed up by a sequence of button taps.

SNK also added a &quot;suicide&quot; move, allowing a player to forfeit a round. The advantage to this is that the one committing suicide will start the next round with a full &quot;POW&quot; gauge. Certain finishes also enable a &quot;fatality&quot; move in the vein of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;.

Some of the series&apos; older characters were restored for the 4th game, including Charlotte, Tam Tam and Jubei Yagyu. The entire cast of the previous game also returns, although some have been redrawn to further enhance the cartoonish look.

Joining the cast are the two ninja brothers:

* Kazuki Kazama - member of the Kazama ninja clan specializing in fire jutsu, he deserts to rescue his younger sister, Hazuki, from Amakusa&apos;s clutches.
    
* Sogetsu Kazama - older brother to Kazuki and Hazuki who uses water jutsu; unlike Kazuki, he stays with the clan and is ordered to assassinate his brother for leaving.</desc>

Schmeiser Robo (c) 1993 Hot-B.

Schmeiser Robo plays similarly to other 2-D versus fighting games during its release, which the player&apos;s character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. However, unlike most other fighting games released at the same time, the game uses an 8-way joystick and 3 buttons: one for punching, another for kicking, and the last one first introduced in the game during the modern era of fighting games, the guard button. Every character can do moving and attacking in spite of repeatedly pressing the guard button; however, they can&apos;t block their opponents&apos; attacks by using it. Other unique features introduced in this game are quick (or small) jumping, air-guarding, counter-attacking, guard-canceling and rush-attacking.</desc>

Secret Agent (c) 1989 Data East.

Secret Agent is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up which the player takes on the role of a James Bond-esque secret agent who must fight his way through a terrorist group called &apos;CWD&apos; to reach the final Boss confrontation and prevent a stolen nuclear missile being launched.

The player starts the game armed only with a pistol, and this has a limited amount of ammunition. Once the ammo has run out, players can only kick their enemies. Machine guns are occasionally dropped by defeated enemies and can be picked up and used. Also, Golden Gun components are sometimes dropped; there are six of these in total and once all have been collected, the player is rewarded with a very powerful golden rifle. This weapon kills all enemies instantly but will only last for twenty-five seconds, indicated by a meter at the top-right of the screen.

Most of the game&apos;s eight stages are platform-based, but there are also two underwater scuba levels and a motorbike chase. All of the game&apos;s end-of-level bosses reappear on the final &apos;underground lair&apos; level.

While not officially licensed as a James Bond game, Secret Agent is unmistakably meant to represent both the Bond character and movie series. The Bond villain Jaws shows up at the end of stage two and another famous Bond villain, Odd Job also appears. Another memorable Bond reference is the use of a Shaun Connery impersonator who tells players that they have done a Great job upon completion of a level.</desc>

Section Z (c) 1985 Capcom Company, Limited.

As a sole astronaut, you must penetrate the alien Balangool space craft and destroy the evil &apos;L-Brain&apos;. Make your way through 27 alphabet-labeled levels to find his lair.

The player maneuvers the space ranger throughout the enemy space station, which consists of 26 alphabetically ordered corridors known as &quot;sections&quot;, starting from Section A and ending at the titular Section Z. The game is divided into five stages, each consisting of five sections (with the final stage having six sections to accommodate the spare letter). The player will fight an enemy boss at the end of each stage, concluding with the final battle against the &quot;L Brain&quot; at Section Z. The game&apos;s stages alternates between horizontal-scrolling stage (left or right) and upwards vertical-scrolling stages. The player will lose a life every time they get hit by enemy fire. Additional lives can be obtained if the player achieves a high enough score. The game will be over if the player loses all of their lives, although a chance to continue will be provided.

The controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two buttons, one for shooting and the other for changing the character&apos;s aim to the left or right. This allows the player to shoot at one direction while moving away towards the opposite. The player will shoot their rifle towards the left or the right with the fire button, while dropping bombs at the same time to the ground. By destroying certain dome-shaped containers, the player can obtain one of three power-up items represented by letters: S, P, and B. S increases the player&apos;s mobility speed, while P increases their firing power; each can improved for up to three increments. However, these power-ups will be lost whenever the player loses a life. The B item will simply give the player bonus points</desc>

Sengoku 3 (c) 2001 SNK.

Sengoku 3 is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players that differs from other games in the genre due to the complexity of its chain-combo based combat system. Rather than being limited to that standard one attack button, one jump button and a life-draining special move, Sengoku&apos;s button set-up is more akin to a one-on-one fighting game, with a light attack, heavy attack and long-ranged attack button, all of which can be utilised to create combos. 

Rather than simply mashing the attack buttons to create combo attacks, each of the game&apos;s four playable characters has an arsenal of special moves using directional inputs. Each character also has a super bar and several super moves that use varying levels of energy from this bar.

&quot;Sengoku 3&quot; also introduces throwing weapons to the series but rather than just picking up dropped items and using them immediately, the game allows players to stash ranged weapons (but only one type at a time) including shuriken, bombs and kunai. As well as hitting enemies from distance, these weapons can also be integrated into players&apos; attack combos.

Each stage end with a boss fight and two of the game&apos;s end-of-level bosses, once defeated, can later be selected as playable characters for the final two stages. The game&apos;s four playable characters (and two bosses who can become playable) are:

* Kegatsura

A Ninja and the main character of Sengoku 3. He&apos;s slower and stronger than average. His first super move is a diagonal downward beam of energy from his sword. For his second super move, he energizes himself with electricity and dashes forwards, slicing anything in his path as he streaks across the screen. He can also use the classic ninja staple; the Izuna Drop. His ultimate move is a lightning spell. 

* Falcon

A Spanish Ninja adept at very long combos. His first super move is a flame projectile shaped like a phoenix. His second is a dashing move. If he connects with an enemy during the dash, he performs a quick combo ending with a powerful flaming sword uppercut. His ultimate is a fire spell. 

* Kurenai

A female Ninja, Kurenai is the fastest character but also the weakest. She has excellent combo potential and is good for keeping multiple enemies at bay. Her first special is a spinning tornado slash. Her second special involves her creating three duplicates and dashing in various directions, hitting anything in her vicinity. Her ultimate </desc>

Shadow Dancer - Kage no Mai (c) 1989 Sega.

A loose sequel to 1988&apos;s &quot;Shinobi&quot;, Shadow Dancer stars a young Ninja who, together with his faithful canine companion, must battle against a terrorist group. The terrorist group have planted a number of time bombs throughout the metropolis. The Ninja and his dog must set out to gather up all the explosives placed by the evil gang and to annihilate the criminal mastermind.

Game-play is very similar to that of the original Shinobi, and features the jumping and projectile weapon-based game-play of its illustrious older brother. However, a new and crucial attacking move has since been added to the Ninja&apos;s arsenal. Pulling DOWN on the joystick and pressing the ATTACK button sends the hero&apos;s dog to attack the nearest enemy. This will stop the enemy from attacking the player as he wrestles with the dog. The enemy must be killed quickly, however, or the dog itself will be killed. If the dog is attacked, he will turn into a small puppy, and once the player has killed a set number of enemies, the puppy will grow to be a full-sized dog who can once again be used to attack enemies.</desc>

Shadow Force - Henshin Ninja (c) 1993 Technos.

Shadow Force is a side-scrolling platform beat-em-up for one or two players, who choose to play as one of four Ninjas and must use all the means at their disposal to free the world from the grip of the evil Dr. Wong and his terrifying &apos;Theaser&apos; organization.

Shadow Force has 6 buttons: 2 for punches (low and high) 2 for kicks (low and high) 1 for jumping and 1 for possessing an enemy. Additional attack moves can be utilised by moving the joystick up or down and pressing punch and kick buttons. It&apos;s also possible to combine punch and kick attacks to obtain different combos and while the enemies can do the same, the number and variation of their attacks is generally lower than those available to the players.

In addition to being able to possess nearby enemies, Shadow Force also features something else new to the side-scrolling beat-em-up genre; at the end of each stage players take part in a bonus round consisting of a one-on-one fight. 

Players can choose to start on any one of the first three stages and the game features 14 different possible endings.</desc>

Shinobi (c) 1987 Sega Enterprises, Limited.

Shinobi is a scrolling platform beat-em-up in which the player takes on the role of Joe Musashi, a Shinobi Ninja, who must fight his way through 5 tough missions - each made up of between 3 to 5 stages - in his quest to rescue the kidnapped Ninja children of the Iga clan; now hostages of an evil Ninja syndicate called &quot;Zeed&quot;. To complete a mission, the player must rescue all of the kidnapped children on each level, with the number of hostages remaining displayed on a meter in the bottom left corner of the screen.

The Shinobi Ninja begins each level armed with either &apos;shuriken&apos; throwing stars or a gun for long-range attacks; and a Samurai sword for close-range combat. In addition, the Ninja also has one &apos;Magic Attack&apos; per level; a smart bomb which kills or damages all on-screen enemies. A points bonus is awarded whenever a level is completed without the Magic Attack being used. An end-of-level guardian awaits the player at the end of each mission, and each takes several hits before it is killed. Once a boss is defeated, the player is taken to a bonus stage in which a large number of Ninjas will try to &apos;jump&apos; from the back of the screen to the front to attack the player. A bonus life is awarded if the player manages to kill all of the Ninjas without being attacked.

Shinobi was a huge success for Sega, and deservedly so. Its perfectly realized blend of platform and fighting action and is as fine an exponent of the &apos;easy to get into, difficult to master&apos; gameplay ethic as video games have seen.</desc>

Shock Troopers (c) 1997 SNK.

Shock Troopers pits the players against a mighty terrorist group who are holding a girl hostage, in order to force her grandfather to surrender a powerful drug which will enable the terrorists to control the minds of the grandfather&apos;s soldiers and create a huge, unstoppable army.

Shock Troopers is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players that builds upon the foundations laid by Capcom&apos;s 1985 classic, &quot;Commando (Capcom)&quot; and also borrows heavily from Commando&apos;s sequel, &apos;&quot;Mercs&quot;. As well as enemy troops, players must contend with tanks, choppers and assorted military vehicles, and must also be careful to avoid any of the landmines that litter the levels. Extra weapons and health can be picked up from destroyed enemy vehicles, as well as being found in enemy supply crates. Shock Troopers is effectively three games in one as players can chose one of three different routes; each made up of different levels. The game also offers greater variety of gameplay than other of the genre; with levels having the players travel on the back of fast moving vehicles, climbing a rock face etc.</desc>

Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad (c) 1998 SNK.

More of an update than a full-blown sequel, Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad picks up where the first game - released a year earlier - left off. Once again, one or two players face the might of a terrorist army who are threatening to destroy the world by launching a newly developed weapon-of-mass-destruction if their wishes - to be given absolute control of the newly-founded nation of Billberk - aren&apos;t granted.

Like many Neo Geo sequels, 2nd Squad doesn&apos;t particularly do anything the original didn&apos;t do. There are some improvements, however; graphics have been given a brush up and level design is a little more imaginative than that of the already impressive original.</desc>

Hyper Dyne SIDE ARMS (c) 1986 Capcom.

An evil alien race called the &apos;Bozon&apos; are trying to wipe out Mankind, and Lieutenant Henry and Sergent Sanders are given the responsibility of saving the Human Race. They each climb into a Mobilsuit - a jet-powered, heavily armoured combat suit - and set out on their mission. 

Side Arms is a horizontally - and occasionally vertically - scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players. Each player has two fire buttons, one for shooting ahead and one for shooting behind; crucial for a game in which enemies attack from all directions. Shooting certain enemies will reveal power-ups - displayed as &apos;POW&apos; icons - and shooting the icons will either change their type, or reveal a special weapon. 

Finally, Side Arms features a unique power-up. These power-ups are hidden in the level and can be collected by shooting at their location with any weapon. By collecting a circle icon that flashed between the Greek &apos;Beta&apos; and ok, both players can join together to become a single, highly powerful combat unit capable of firing in eight different directions. When a two-player unit is joined, BOTH players&apos; controllers can control the unit&apos;s movement, which can cause the unit to not move if players decide to go in different directions to each other. The player who picks up this power-up will control the main weapon from his current list only and the other player will be able to fire the secondary eight-direction weapon. The eight-direction weapon can be fired by single presses or automatically by holding either fire button. 

In a two-player game, this form will break apart after one hit to the unit, returning to both players individual units. In a one-player game it will break apart after two hits, causing the second unit to be destroyed. 

Appearance of the super unit and the eight-directional weapon is dependant on which player gets the power-up. First-player unit is a primarily orange unit that fires red triangle projectiles one way. Second-player unit is a blue unit that fires blue boomerangs that fly out and return causing a slower rate of fire. 

The 8 available power-ups are: 
* Speed-up (POW symbol) 
* Speed-down (Reverse POW symbol, shows just before reaching Auto I or II) 
* Bit - (3 level power-up) 
* Spread Gun - (3 level power-up) 
* Mega Bazooka Launcher (2 level power-up) 
* 3-Way Shot (2 level power-up) 
* Auto I (Chain gun) 
* Auto II (3-Way Auto)

The Simpsons (c) 1991 Konami.

A jewel heist gone wrong sees Mr Burns&apos;s sidekick, Smithers, kidnapping Maggie and making his escape. Between one and four players take on the role of either Homer, Marge, Lisa, or Bart in this colorful, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up from Konami. Each Simpsons character possesses an attacking move specific to them; Marge is armed with a vacuum cleaner, Lisa has a skipping rope, Bart has his skateboard, and Homer fights with his fists. The players must battle their way through a variety of Simpsons-themed levels - such as Springfield and Krustyland - fighting goons, thugs, zombies, drunks, firemen, and several Simpsons regulars. Many Simpsons characters that don&apos;t appear as enemies have &apos;cameo&apos; scenes in the game (Otto working at a burgerstand in Krustyland, for example). The archetypal &apos;boss&apos; character awaits the players at the end of every stage. The game ends with a final showdown with the evil Mr. Burns in his luxurious mansion.

The Simpsons was designed to Konami&apos;s typically-high production standards and was, like the &apos;Ninja Turtles&apos; games that appeared a couple of years&apos; earlier, very faithful to its source material. The colorful, smoothly-animated sprites captured the spirit of the legendary cartoon superbly, and the game&apos;s many humorous touches were timed to perfection.</desc>

Skull &amp; Crossbones (c) 1989 Atari Games Corporation.

Skull &amp; Crossbones is a swashbuckling adventure in which players portray two pirates competing for food, drink, booty, and revenge. Players use a joystick and button to control the unique sword-fighting action.

The game begins with an encounter with the evil Wizard, who robs our heroes of all of their booty. The pirates swear revenge and set off on a quest to destroy the Wizard and recover their treasure.

The adventure takes them around the world. The pirates battle the fierce captains and crews of opponent ships. They encounter the soldier guards and the merciless Executioner in the Spanish castle. In the ninja camp they fight the Ninja Master and his followers. On the beach the heroes encounter the dreaded Medusa and a horde of wicked skeletons that rise from the dead.

Finally, the pirates reach the Wizard&apos;s Island, where they must again do battle against the shadow figures of the Executioner, the Ninja Master, and the Medusa before they can fight face-to-face with the evil Wizard. If they make it to the throne room and overcome the Wizard, players are rewarded with a room full of treasure.

Players use a joystick and sword button in a combination of defensive and offensive maneuvers to battle the various enemies. Players can learn the lunge and back-slash - two skillful sword-fighting moves that are very effective.

In order to increase the long-term appeal of the game, players can select various difficulty levels of easy, medium, and hard to vary their paths through the game. By selecting the longer hard path, players are rewarded with more food, drink, and booty along the way.</desc>

Sky Kid (c) 1985 Namco.

Sky Kid is a 2-D, scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the character Sky Kid. Sky Kid flies around in a bi-plane and is assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involved bombing specific targets. This would seem easy, however, there are a few obstacles Sky Kid must overcome to get to the target safely. First, the bi-plane is not equipped with the bomb. Sky Kid must pick up the bomb en route to the target. Second, there are both ground and air units that attempt to keep Sky Kid from accomplishing his mission. Last, Sky Kid may have to navigate through some very inhospitable terrain or navigate around cities in order to get to the target. The targets that Sky Kid must bomb will either be a fortress complex or a ship. As one moves farther up in the missions, it isn&apos;t uncommon to have multiple targets in one mission. Perhaps barnstorming would have been a better idea.</desc>

Sky Soldiers (c) 1988 Romstar, Incorporated.

Sky Soldiers is a vertical scrolling Shoot em&apos; Up developed by Alpha Denshi and released to arcades in 1988 by Romstar in North America and SNK for the rest of the world. The game features a time travel theme as well as an organized weapon select screen at the beginning of each stage.

Players travel back in time starting in Great Britain 1945, Germany 1915, Japan 1945, Germany 1944, Vietnam 1974, France 1914, Russia 1974 and finally the space station in the present time, 2110. Each time stage has two levels, both ending in a boss battle save for the final stage, resulting in a total of 15 Areas.

The ship&apos;s weapon system is accessed in the beginning of each stage. The ship’s main shot consists of a semi-automatic Wave Shot. The ship’s bomb weapons include forward firing missiles, fireballs, homing missiles and the buster bomb. The ship can be equipped with only one bomb weapon from either category at a time. The ship can only be loaded with a certain number of Bomb weapons and they can only be resupplied at the end of the level. The only pick-up item in the game is a parachuting human pilot shot down from malfunctioning fighter planes/jets; collecting these pilots results in random bonus points.</desc>

SVC Chaos - SNK Vs. Capcom (c) 2003 Playmore Corp.

A one-on-one fighting game - the collaboration between Capcom and SNK - pits seventeen well-known SNK combatants against seventeen of Capcom&apos;s most famous game characters.

&apos;SVC Chaos&apos; primarily utilizes the command system of the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; series, incorporating light/strong kicks, punches, cancels and charging attacks. Unlike its predecessor, however, &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot;, SvC features no air guards and lacks a &apos;groove system&apos;, instead focusing on quicker game play and online competition.

Each character is equipped with a basic three-bar system for executing &apos;Exceeds&apos; (special attacks), with basic filling options attributed to strikes and damage. Additionally, the sprites from the various series received new models and some special effects were changed in the command lists (For example, the player can no longer increase the damage of the &apos;Zujou Sashi&apos; used by Choi Bounge by tapping the buttons).</desc>

Snow Bros. - Nick &amp; Tom (c) 1990 Toaplan.

One or two players take on the roles of snowmen Nick and Tom as they battle a variety of monsters over fifty platform-based, single screen levels. 

The snowmen can throw snowballs at the enemies with the aim of encasing them completely in snow. The encased enemies can then be kicked in order to destroy them and this is achieved by standing next to the snowball and pressing the &quot;kick out&quot; button. This sends the giant snowball flying around the screen, killing any enemies that lay in its path. 

If players take too much time to complete a stage, an evil pumpkin head will appear and try to kill them. The pumpkin is invincible but can be stunned with snowballs. After a short time the evil pumpkin will spawn ghosts that can travel freely around the stage as they seek out Nick and Tom. These ghosts can&apos;t be killed or stunned, so the player&apos;s only hope is to avoid them while eliminating the remaining standard enemies, to move on to the next screen as soon as possible.

When players defeat an enemy, it may drop a coloured potion bottle. These can be picked up and act as power-ups:
* Yellow = Long shot
* Red = Speed up
* Blue = Bigger snowballs (encases monsters quicker)
* Green = Inflates the players like a balloon and lets them fly around the screen, killing any monsters they touch.

Every 10th level features a battle with a large end-of-level boss.</desc>

    <desc>Arcade Video game published 37 years ago:

Son Son (c) 1984 Capcom Company, Limited.

The game is a 2-D sidescrolling platformer. The screen scrolls automatically, only stopping to fight major enemies. The screen features six continuous platforms that occasionally feature small gaps. Sonson and Tonton walk automatically across these platforms. Pressing up or down will cause them to jump up or down to the next platform. Pressing left causes them to move more slowly than the screen scrolls, essentially continuing to move forward but at a reduced pace. Pressing right does the opposite - SonSon and TonTon will move across the platforms faster than the screen scrolls. The duo have only one attack - the ability to fire energy blasts from their staves. Touching an enemy or an unfriendly projectile causes the player to lose a life. If a player has any additional lives, they will return to the screen riding on a cloud that will give them temporary invincibility. If the player presses the control stick in any direction, the cloud will disappear and the character will resume its usual walking mode. The cloud will eventually disappear on its own if the control stick is not used.

Power-ups come in the form of various fruits which produce points (with enough points giving the player an extra life). Gathering certain fruit will cause all enemies currently on a screen to turn into point-bearing fruits. Walking across certain platforms will randomly cause a bamboo shoot to sprout, yielding many extra points. Keep in mind that it is possible to play the game co-operatively with partner who plays as TonTon.</desc>

Space Invaders DX (c) 1994 Taito Corp.

A modern and fitting tribute to Taito&apos;s 1978 seminal shoot-em-up, &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. 

There are now 3 different game modes to choose from. These include a faithful recreation of the legendary original - available in both upright and cocktail versions - and replete with a simulation of the infamous &quot;coloured plastic overlay&quot; that was used to add the impression of full colour graphics to the original game.

The 2 remaining game modes are &apos;Versus&apos;, with simultaneous split-screen 2-player action, and &quot;Parody&quot;, which features characters and graphics from other well-known Taito games, such as &quot;The New Zealand Story&quot;, &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; and &quot;Liquid Kids&quot;. Despite the graphical changes, the Parody version plays identically to the original game, and all modes retain the original, legendary sound effects.</desc>

Spelunker (c) 1986 Irem Corp.

In Spelunker - which means &apos;cave-diver&apos; - a caver has to work his way down through a number of multi-directionally scrolling caves - each one deeper underground than the last - in his bid to find the mythical &apos;World of Wonders&apos;. To do this, the spelunker must find the exit to each cave, so he can move on to the next and get closer to his goal.

Spelunker is a platform game, and each tricky cave is filled with enemies - such as bats and ogres - and traps. Ladders, ropes, lifts and the obligatory minecarts must be used to reach other platforms and sections of the cave.

To aid him in his difficult quest, the Spelunker carries a gun and can shoot short-range fireballs at his enemies to stun or kill them. Numerous bonus items can be collected, such as bombs to destroy any rocks block his route, keys to open locked doors and potions to boost the caver&apos;s ever-decreasing energy meter. Treasure chests also litter each cave, and can be opened for bonus treasure items.</desc>

Sprint 8 (c) 1977 Atari.

In this game you control a race car on a semi-complicated track. You are looking down on the action from above. Your only goal is to drive around the track as many times as possible, and as fast as you can. There will be eight cars on the track at all times. With the computer controlling cars for missing players. The sheer number of cars can make this game a little confusing. All the cars have minor variations to set them apart from the others, but are similar enough that you simply cannot look away from the track for a second. If you are used to the other Sprint games, you will find that this one is a bit different, the graphics are slightly higher in resolution, and the tracks are much more complex, and have a different look to them, not to mention the fact that this version adds a brake pedal that was absent in the other Sprint titles. The game has several different tracks available, and you can select them with a button at the start of a match. The graphics are simple black and white with two shades of gray thrown in for good measure. They are simple, but they get the job done. The game will rate you at the end, you can get rated Granny, Rookie, or Pro, and getting a score over 250 points will extend the game an extra 30 seconds.</desc>

Star Trek - Strategic Operations Simulator (c) 1982 Sega.

STAR TREK is a 1- or 2-player SEGA Color X-Y video game with computerized speech synthesis. The player finds himself the Captain of the Starship Enterprise, his mission being to rid the universe of a number of threats to the United Federation of Planets.

STAR TREK has a unique method of displaying the information vital to the game play. This method involves the separation of the CRT into three completely separate screens.

The Scanner is where the player sees a top down or plan view of local space, with the Enterprise always in the center of this screen. The Viewer is where the player sees actual apparent 3-D images, as if he were looking out the ships front window. The Status screen displays player score in addition to Shield strength, number of Photon Torpedoes, and amount of Warp energy remaining.

The game begins by introducing Klingons, Starbases and the Enterprise into the Scanner with an exciting shrink down animation sequence. The Enterprise starts with 1 to 4 Shields and Photon Torpedoes (switch selectable). By actuating the rotary knob and depressing the Thrust button the player may maneuver about the Scanner screen.

In order to destroy enemies the player may use either of two weapons: Phasers (the Fire button) or Photon Torpedoes. Each has unique properties.
* Phasers are instantaneous, can destroy only one enemy at a time, and are in unlimited energy supply.
* Photon Torpedoes require time to travel, can destroy many enemies, and are in LIMITED supply. Displayed in the Status screen, Photon Torpedo supply appears as a red bar (squares).

For high speed, the player may depress the WARP button. While this button is held down the Enterprise moves very quickly and cannot be damaged in any way by anything. A blue bar in the Status screen displays the amount of Warp energy available, and shrinks as the Warp button is held down.

The Enterprise is shrouded by an automatic Shield, which protects the Enterprise from enemy fire and collisions. The Shields are displayed in the Status screen as green line segments (a bar). Once the strength of the Shields is depleted, the ship can sustain damage. When damaged, the Enterprise looses ship functions in the following order: Shields, Photon Torpedoes, Warp Drive. If all of these are damaged, the next hit will destroy the Enterprise and end the game.

In order to repair this damage the player may choose to doc</desc>

The game&apos;s sit-down cabinet featured a seat that vibrated whenever the player was hit, either by incoming fire or by enemy objects such as ships, asteroids etc. The yoke joystick - which had a fire button situated at the top of the stick, underneath where the player&apos;s thumb sits - was very similar in appearance and feel to that used in Atari&apos;s 1983 wireframe classic, &quot;Star Wars (Atari)&quot;.</desc>

Street Fighter III - 3rd Strike: Fight For The Future (c) 1999 Capcom.

Street Fighter III 3rd Strike is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players and is the second follow-up to &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;, following &quot;Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact&quot;. 

3rd Strike increased the character roster by adding five new characters, notably including the legendary Chun-Li. New characters Remy, Makoto, Q, and Twelve were also added, bringing the total number of playable fighters to twenty. Also re-introduced was the fan-favourite &apos;Destroy the Car&apos; bonus stage. 

One of the new gameplay mechanics introduced in &quot;3rd Strike&quot; is the Guard Parry, also known as the &apos;Red Parry&apos;, which allows players to parry during guard stun, providing the timing is correct. Another new feature is after-match player evaluations in which the winner of a two-person match is graded in Offense, Defence, Tech and Extra. In single-player Arcade mode the player will always be evaluated, even in event of a loss. The grades range from E (lowest) to MSF, or Master Street Fighter (highest).

The single-player mode consists of fighting ten regular opponents, which includes a character-specific rival as the penultimate opponent and &apos;Gill&apos; as the final boss for each of the characters except for Gill himself, whose final boss is Alex. Despite his status as a regularly selectable character, the CPU version of Q can only be fought in the single-player mode as a secret challenger. Clearing the game with every character, including Gill, unlocks the extra options, including infinite super arts, will be available for toggling on and off. The full roster of playable characters are as follows:

** Returning 2nd Impact characters **

AKUMA
Appears in 2nd Impact as a secret character and has a non-playable &quot;Shin Akuma&quot; version which can be selected in the Dreamcast version of the game in 2nd Impact. 

ALEX
The lead character of the Street Fighter III games. He fights with close-range wrestling and quick rushing attacks. His goal is to avenge the defeat of his friend, Tom, at the hands of Gill. 

DUDLEY
A dandy British boxer who, having been knighted since making a comeback and winning the championship title, enters the tournament to train for a contest that will be held in the presence of the British Royal Family. 

ELENA
An African princess who uses the fighting style of capoeira. She seeks to make new friends.

Street Smart (c) 1989 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

You begin by choosing one of 2 fighters (either a blond guy, or a dark haired guy in karate gear). Then you are whisked away to one of many cities on the map to have a battle. The opponents are tough, but simple. This game has no special moves (and has only punch, kick, and jump buttons), and all characters have insanely high energy. So you pretty much just wail away at each other with punches and kicks until someone falls down. An ambulance will show up to haul away your defeated opponent, and a girl in the audience will come out to congratulate you.</desc>

Strikeforce (c) 1991 Midway.

Strike Force is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up and is the third game in Midway&apos;s seminal &quot;Defender&quot; series. Saurian lizard men have overrun all twenty-two planets that form the New Earth Solar System colonies, capturing and mutating the resident humans into reptiles to use as slave labour at their stronghold base, the Saurian &apos;Mega-Star Apocalypse&apos;.

Players fly a spaceship over the surface of the of planets, destroying enemy waves and rescuing humans from the alien invaders, with rescued humans hanging from the underside of the player&apos;s ship. Once these tasks have been completed, the mothership arrives to pick up the player&apos;s ship, together with any humans they have rescued. Players can decide which planets to attack, when to purchase additional firepower and when to attack the Apocalypse.

Strike Force adds several new features to the series. Two players can now share the screen at one time and the surface of each planet is littered with various special weapons that can be picked up and deployed. Humans can be &apos;mutated&apos; into small green creatures that will fight against the player (although players can still pick them up for points as, with the unmutated humans). The mutants can also use vehicles found on the planet&apos;s surface against the player.</desc>

Strikers 1945 (c) 1995 Psikyo.

In 1945, the second world war ended. Soon, there was peace, but an organization of high-ranking military officers from all over the world form a global army known as CANY. Their mission was to conquer the world. CANY activity was found in areas like the Soviet Union, America, Japan, and even Germany. It is revealed that CANY had weapons never seen before from rockets to mechanical walkers. The world quickly formed a group of pilots and planes called the Strikers whose mission is to rid of CANY from the world.</desc>

Strikers 1945 Plus (c) 1999 Psikyo.

After inserting quarters and hitting the Start button, the player chooses one of 6 planes (plus 1 hidden plane) or can opt for a random choice.

The available fighters are:
* P-38 Lightning
* Vought XF5U &apos;Flying Pancake&apos;
* Spitfire Mk. VI
* Zero Type 52
* Focke Wulf Ta 152
* Fiat G.56
* XP-55 Ascender (Hidden) 

The first 4 stages are in random order, while the last 4 are sequential. Players collect weapon powerups, bombs, and gold bars for points. Each plane has a unique &apos;supershot&apos; which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored, although the number varies from plane to plane. Using a Bomb results in a large friendly fighter swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds.

After the player beats the final boss, the game starts again from the beginning, albeit at a much higher difficulty level. All level are similar to the ones in Strikers 1945 II. Only one of the 4 bosses that are randomly chosen and the 6th boss is changed.</desc>

Subroc-3D (c) 1982 Sega.

SUBROC-3D is an overwhelming 3-dimensional game, with a dual scene system for battles in the ocean or in space. The graphics and sound effects are very exciting!

You command a sophisticated craft and by using the elevation controls you can move it up or down so it can be operated under water or in space.

The periscope-type viewer can be moved from side to side, enabling you to attack more enemies.

Preen the fire button to shoot down the enemy.

The dynamic stereo sound system creates an amazingly realistic surround effect.

Many strangely-shaped crafts, missiles and UFOs suddenly zoom in to attack you; once they are in your sights they can attack you, so shoot first and survive!

The 3-dimensional effect of fast-moving crafts and missiles, combined with the terrifying  explosions seemingly right up close to you are truly bewildering.

To destroy the BARRIER guarding the enemy COMMAND SHIP, you must hit it in the very center.

After blowing up the COMMAND SHIP, you proceed to another round.

The bonus points remaining will be added to your score.

When you reach HIGH SCORE you will get another ship.

In each successive round the score increases by 100 points over the previous round.

Your score and the round are displayed at the top of the screen. Your score and the previous best three scores are displayed over the periscope.

Play ends with the loss of your last ship.</desc>

Super Burger Time (c) 1990 Data East.

Super Burger Time is a platform game for one or two players - and sequel to the 1982 original - in which Peter Pepper must once again prepare a set number of burgers per stage, by collecting the separate ingredients needed and dropping them onto plates at the bottom of the screen. 

Stages consist of platforms joined by connecting ladders. At the bottom of each stage are a number of empty plates and the burger ingredients lay across  platforms situated directly above the plates. Peter must make ingredients drop to the platform below, until all ingredients are on the plate and the burger is complete. All burgers must be assembled to complete a stage. Ingredients include the top and bottom of the bun, the meat patty and various garnishes, such as lettuce and tomatoes.

The chef is once again pursued by rogue ingredients, including fried eggs, sausages and green-pea pods. Differences to gameplay from the original include simultaneous two-player action, and the ability to jump. Indeed, peter must now jump on the burger ingredients several times to get them to drop, rather than simply walking over them as in the original game. Many of the game&apos;s stages are now bigger than a single screen (another change from the original) and the display scrolls to accommodate this.

To help peter deal with the angry ingredients, he can utilize numerous kitchen-based items, including pepper (the sole weapon of the original game), a skewer, a frying pan and a water hose. Another new addition to Peter&apos;s world are boss battles, with the Chef having to throw burgers to defeat the bosses.</desc>

Super Pang (c) 1990 Mitchell Corp.

Super Bang is a sequel to the 1989 original in which one or two players control characters armed with harpoon guns who must destroy the numerous different-sized balloons that bounce around each single-screen stage. When hit by a harpoon, the balloons break down into smaller fragments, in a similar fashion to Atari&apos;s 1979 classic, &quot;Asteroids&quot;. 

Players can only fire the harpoon guns virtually upwards but can move left and right and climb the ladders that appear on many of the stages. The game has two different modes of play:

* PANIC MODE
In this mode, players face an endless rain of bubbles and must simply last as long as possible. The default weapon is the bubble shot and cannot be changed at any time. Each time a bubble is popped, a rainbow bar at the bottom is slowly filled. Filling the bar all the way raises the level number and the bar depletes back to zero. As more bubbles are popped, both remaining and incoming bubbles move faster. A &apos;Panic&apos; music plays when there&apos;s a very large amount of bubbles on the screen, but the normal music returns once enough bubbles are popped.

There is also one special type of bubble that appears rarely. The bubble has a clock image engraved. Whenever the bubble bounces, the engraving changes to a star, and when the bubble bounces again, the engraving changes back to a clock. Popping the bubble when the clock engraving is present causes all bubbles to stop movement completely for 9 seconds, while popping the bubble when the star engraving is present causes all bubbles to be popped and the game screen gets cleared.

* TOUR MODE
In this mode players move from stage to stage, travelling around the world. The introductory stage is set in Japan and is the only stage set in this location. After Japan, players travel to parts of Asia, Europe and the Americas. Each location has three stages, with each set at a different time of day: daytime, evening and night. The few exceptions to the three-stage rule are Venice (evening and night stages only), The Mayan Ruins and the Caribbean Sea (both having only day and evening stages).

Each stage has a set layout, consisting of walls, destructible glass walls, invisible walls, ladders and ice. There are forty different stages in the Tour mode.</desc>

Super Trio (c) 1994 Gameace.

Super Trio is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up for one or two players who take control of one of the three animals: a mouse called Jake, a cat called Tomi, or a dog called Brudo. All three characters play the same, with the only differences being visual. 

Players must shoot and jump fight their way to the end-of-level exit to face off against the enemy boss and progress to bonus stage or next level. 

During play, direction prompts appear on-screen to advise players of where they need to go to reach the exit. Numerous pick-ups litter the stages to help make life easier for the player; these include health-replenishing food, invincibility, lightning bolts that kill all on-screen enemies, winged shoes for faster running and weapon upgrades. Each animal can upgrade its weapon up to four times to increase attack power.

Super Trio consists of twelve different stages.</desc>

Tang Tang (c) 2000 ESD.

Tang Tang is a platform/puzzle hybrid for one or two players; based heavily on Tecmo&apos;s superb 1986 release, &quot;Solomon&apos;s Key - Solomon no Kagi&quot;. The players&apos; characters are armed with a magic wand, which can be used to both destroy and create blocks to use as platforms and barriers. Players can remove platform blocks directly above their characters&apos; heads by repeatedly jumping up into them until they break.

To complete a level, players must collect all of the circle/diamond items that litter each screen. Once all of these have been collected, a door will appear through which the player must exit to complete the level.</desc>

Teddy Boy Blues - Yohko Ishino (c) 1985 Sega.

A strange and unique platform game by Sega. Guide Teddy Boy through an ever scrolling maze to defeat ninjas, snails, big mouthed hippos and other bizarre creatures.

You shoot your enemies with a gun that shrinks them - then you must collect your shrunken foes for bonus points. If you don&apos;t collect them quick enough, they will fly down to the bottom of the screen and eat a portion of your time meter.

Occasionally you will get a chance to play a bonus game as Teddy Boy or Yohko Ishino. A target shooting game can be played as Teddy, and as Yohko, you can enjoy a short treasure hunting game.</desc>

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles スーパー亀忍者  (c) 1989 Konami.
(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Super Kame Ninja)

A sideways scrolling beat-em-up in which up to four players can choose to play as either &apos;Leonardo&apos; (blue, katana blades), &apos;Raphael&apos; (red, sais), &apos;Michaelangelo&apos; (orange, nunchakas) or &apos;Donatello&apos; (purple, bo staff) as the infamous turtles fight against the might of Shredder&apos;s army to try and rescue &apos;April O&apos;Neil&apos; and &apos;Splinter&apos;, before a final confrontation with their arch-enemies &apos;Krang&apos; and &apos;The Shredder&apos;.

Ninja Turtles featured just two buttons - for &apos;Jump&apos; and &apos;Attack&apos; - making for simple and immediate gameplay. Visually the game made great use of its license and perfectly captured the spirit of both the original comic-book and cartoon series upon which it was based. The game also featured a &apos;buy-in&apos; option, meaning that new players could join in at any time.</desc>

Tekken 2 (c) 1995 Namco.

Two years after winning the original &apos;King of the Iron Fist&apos; tournament, Kazuya Mishima decides to hold a second tournament in an attempt to finish off his father, Heihachi Mishima, in this sequel to 1994 original.

The gameplay in Tekken 2 is identical to that of its predecessor, with one or two players fighting over a series of 3D-rendered backdrops. As before, the fighting system utilises four attack buttons: left punch, right punch, left kick and right kick. Certain button combinations will initiate both standard and special grab and throwing moves.</desc>

Tekken Tag Tournament (c) 1999 Namco.

Tekken Tag Tournament is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players, in which teams of two combatants compete in the legendary Iron Fist Tournament. 

At any point during a match, players can hit a tag button to their two fighters fighter, allowing the resting fighter to recover some lost health. The tag can be implemented in many ways, such as in between combos or utilizing special throws. At times when a resting fighter&apos;s lifebar is flashing, that character can be tagged in to be given a temporary boost in strength.

The game features over 35 characters that previously appeared in &quot;Tekken 2&quot; and &quot;Tekken 3&quot;. In addition, there is a new boss character called &apos;Unknown&apos; who is similar to Mokujin from &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, in that she can randomly imitate any character&apos;s fighting style, although one difference from Mokujin is that she is able to change her style any time during the fight. 

To win the entire tournament, players must defeat six other teams before fighting their character-specific sub-bosses in the seventh round. The eighth and final round is the battle for the title against the mysterious &quot;Unknown&quot;. The first tag team to have one of its pairing defeated results in that team being knocked out of the tournament.</desc>

Tempest (c) 1981 Atari.

Tempest is a classic into-the-screen shoot-em-up in which the player controls a claw-shaped &quot;Blaster&quot; ship that moves around the outer rim of a three-dimensional, wireframe tunnel. Enemies move down the tunnel towards the player&apos;s Blaster ship and must be destroyed. Any contact with either incoming enemy fire or the enemies themselves will cost the player a life. Completion of a tunnel will see the player warp through &quot;hyperspace&quot; to the next tunnel to tackle a new wave of enemies. 

The tunnels are each rendered in one of sixteen different geometric shapes. Enemies increase in number as the game progresses and if an enemy reaches the outer rim occupied by the player&apos;s Blaster ship, it will chase and attempt to kill the player. Rim enemies can be killed, but this is difficult to achieve. 

Some enemies also drag &quot;spikes&quot; - in the form of lines in the middle of the corridor - behind them as they travel up the tunnel towards the player. These spikes must be avoided during the &quot;hyperspace&quot; warp sequence at the end of the level, as contact results in the loss of a life. 

Two &quot;SuperZappers&quot; are available per level. The first SuperZapper kills all enemies on the playfield at the time of firing, while the second randomly kills only one enemy on the playfield. The SuperZapper does not affect enemy shots, spikes or enemies that have not yet landed on the playfield. 

One new feature Tempest introduces is &quot;Skill-Step&quot;. This allows players to start a new game on the same level as was previously reached (although the new game must be restarted within thirty seconds) without having to replay previous levels. This allows skillful players to continue being challenged, while less experienced players can try to master higher levels. The 99 skill levels of play includes sixteen different playfields and seven different enemy targets. 

* The tubes are divided into cosmic corridors through which the aliens travel, although some aliens such as Pulsars and Flippers can move from one corridor to the next. Regardless of the tube shapes, aliens always begin their invasion from the small, distant end of the tube. The sixteen unique tube shapes are as follows: 

1. Circle 
2. Square 
3. Plus symbol 
4. Bow-tie 
5. Stylized Cross 
6. Triangle 
7. Clover 
8. V 
9. Steps 
10. U 
11. Completely Flat 
12. Heart 
13. Star 
14. W 
15. Fan 
16. Infinity Symbol (figure 8 on its side)

Thrash Rally (c) 1991 Alpha Denshi.

Thrash Rally is a top-down perspective rally racing game for one or two players. Each race begins with players asked to choose a vehicle in which to race, with each offering a different balance between handling, acceleration, vehicle endurance and top speed. 

There are two racing modes on offer. The first, World Rally Championship, features rounds that take place over lap-based circuits, with each lap having to be completed within a set time limit. World Rally mode offers players a choice of six different rally cars.

The second mode is the Paris-to-Dakar rally. This doesn’t feature laps but is a point-to-point race, with each stage having to be completed within a set time limit. In addition to the six rally cars of the World Rally mode, the Paris-to-Dakar Rally also allows players to race in either a buggy, a motorbike, or a truck.

All tracks feature a variety of different road surfaces, such as snow, gravel, sand or water. Many of the tracks also feature a variety of jumps and chicanes, as well as track-based obstacles that should be avoided.</desc>

Thunder Cross II (c) 1991 Konami.

Taking place in the future of space colonization, the planet Haniamu IV is under attack from a relentless, unknown military force known only as Black Impulse. The strongest Earth ships capable of stopping the total conquering of the planet are the Blue Thunder M-45 (player 1) and the Red Thunder M-24 (player 2).

Thunder Cross is a classic horizontal shooter with 7 stages. Players control the Thunder fighter with up to four &quot;options&quot;, which arrange up and down vertically and add to the player&apos;s attack power. Three weapons are selectable ranging from the Vulcan shot to the Laser and the Boomerang shot (which doubles as a ricochet weapon). Typical of a Konami shooter, Thunder Cross forces the player to beat the game twice in a harder loop of the first seven levels.</desc>

Tinkle Pit (c) 1994 Namco.

The player contols Pitt and Patti, who must walk around the mazes, collecting items and avoiding enemies. They have the power to drop their Tinker power balls, which are both invulnerable to the enemies, and move around by pressing the Line button, therefore creating a line between them and their power balls. Releasing the button makes their power balls come back to them; the enemies are killed by having the power balls slam into them. There are also pieces of popcorn which can be picked up around the mazes - and pressing the Popcorn button, Pitt and Patti can throw them at the enemies, and they shall bounce off the walls until they hit one (or evaporate if they have not done so by the end of the stage). 

Killing all enemies in a maze advances the player to the next stage; however, in the event of one enemy remaining, he will make for the nearest corner of the maze, say &quot;Bye-bye!&quot;, and disappear - which will detract from the &quot;Pursuit Bonus&quot; that the players will receive after they defeat Mao at the end of the game.</desc>

Toggle (c) 1985 Bally Sente.

A shoot &apos;em up where the player and the computer duel in a well/arena in tanks, where the red tank shoots vertically and the yellow tank shoots horizontally. A level is won by beating the computer in the amount of squares claimed. A square is claimed by running over it with the tank, where it turns the color of the tank that ran over it. There are special items that reverse the squares claimed by the player and computer, other ones that fill an entire row of squares with the color of the tank that got the bonus, and others that speed up the tanks&apos; speed. The player has to have more squares claimed at the time the race/duel ends, and can disable the computer&apos;s tank by shooting it up close or by smashing into it at the sides that don&apos;t have the cannons.</desc>

Top Hunter - Roddy &amp; Cathy (c) 1994 SNK.

Top Hunter: Roddy &amp; Cathy is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players who take on the role of the galaxy&apos;s top bounty hunters, Roddy and Cathy, who are sent to put a stop to a colony of galactic pirates called the Klaptons, who threaten and plunder the cosmos. Four high-ranking Klaptons have taken control of four elemental planets and big rewards are offered for the capture of Sly, Misty, Mr. Bigman and Dr. Burn.

The game&apos;s action takes place on two plains, with players able to jump between the foreground and background at will. This switching mechanic is integral to getting through some parts of the game. In addition to standard jump and attack mechanics, both players have the ability to extend their arms outwards. This ability can be used to grab items and enemies, some of which can then be thrown. The arm can also be extended vertically upwards, allowing players to pull themselves up onto ledges, pull items down to them, or pull handles to trigger events, such as dropping rocks onto enemies.

Each stage has several collectables to be found, including health, weapon power-ups and extra time. At certain points during a stage, players may come across a Mecha; this is a bi-pedal mechanical walker that gives players more power. The mecha also has limited health, however and the player will be forced out of it when it starts flashing. 

Top Hunter: Roddy &amp; Cathy is split into four planets: Forest, Ice, Wind, and Fire and players can choose which planet to tackle first. Depending on what stage is picked first, the layout of that stage will change. For example, if the player picks the Ice world before the Forest world, the Forest world&apos;s starting layout will be different. 

After completing all four worlds, the player is taken to the final stage, where they must fight a rematch with the four bosses before the final battle with the game&apos;s antagonist, Captain Klapton.</desc>

Tornado Baseball (c) 1976 Midway.

The game is a very simple game of baseball, implemented with stick figures. The game is very simple in terms of rules, and anybody can pick up on how to play fairly quickly. This is a two player only title, with both people playing for a single quarter. The pitching player selects his pitch with one joystick, while moving his outfielders with a second one. The batting player only has a single button (that is a &apos;swing&apos; button). Both players use the same set of controls, so they must switch spots in front of the machine midway through each inning. You get a four inning game for one quarter, although that number can be adjusted by the game operator.</desc>

There are power-ups to increase ship speed, add a smartbomb to your stock, and change/strengthen your current weapon. Red fires bombs in a small area around your ship,  blue is a homing laser, and green fires wide-reaching salvos of green shots.</desc>

Tumble Pop (c) 1991 Data East Corporation.

Tumble Pop is a platform game for one or two players in which the aim is to clear each level of enemies by sucking them into - then ejecting them from - a portable vacuum-cleaner. 

Holding down the fire button sucks the enemies into the cleaner, releasing the button causes them to be expelled back out. Ejected enemies act as projectiles that can damage and kill any other on-screen enemies that they collide with. All enemies must be killed before players can progress to the next stage. 

Throughout the game, letters of the alphabet randomly appear in bubbles. These can be collected to eventually spell the word &quot;TUMBLEPOP&quot;. Once this has been achieved players are transported to a time-limited bonus level, giving them the opportunity to earn bonus points and extra lives. 

If players take too long to finish a stage, a Dracula-like enemy appears. If it touches a player before all enemies have been eliminated, a life is lost. This also applies to the Boss levels. 

The game feature ten stages, with the first eight set in different parts of the World and the final two set in Outer Space. Each stage has its own themed enemies and level bosses and players can choose to start the game on any of the eight World-based stages. The levels and enemies are: 
*Moscow: Set at the Moscow-state circus, enemies are clowns, invisible conjurers and fire spitters. The boss is a giant clown hanging from helium balloons who juggles bombs. 
*Egypt: Set near the pyramids and Sphinx at Giza, enemies include fire spitters and mummies. The boss is a giant genie who spits fireballs. 
*Paris: Set near the Arc de Triomphe, all of the enemies are robots. The boss is a large flying robot that sends out flying hands. 
*New York City: Set near the Statue of Liberty and World Trade Center, the enemies are pumpkin-headed zombies and octopuses. The boss is a giant octopus. 
*Rio de Janeiro: Set near the statue of Christ the Redeemer, enemies are fire monsters. The boss is a fire dragon. 
*Antarctica: Populated by snowmen, snowmen armed with shovels and hairy yeti-like monsters. The boss is a giant snowman wearing a bucket on its head. 
*Australia. Enemies are carnivorous plants, cavemen and mud men. The boss is a giant two-headed carnivorous plant. 
*Japan: Set at Mount Fuji, enemies are yureis, kappas and skeletons. The boss is a giant pile of daruma dolls. 
*Outer Space: Enemies are grey aliens and spacemen</desc>

Twin Eagle - Revenge Joe&apos;s Brother (c) 1988 Seta Company, Limited.

A vertical shoot-em-up that places the player&apos;s helicopter against multiple attacking targets in the air, sea, and land. Collecting the weapon and speed power-ups throughout the game is vital since the gameplay is quite difficult.

The object of the game, which is not explained further, is to avenge Joe&apos;s brother - which is probably not assumed to be the player, but presumably a friend of the player who lost his brother to the enemy. (It uses bad English grammar on the subtitle of the screen, using &quot;revenge&quot; as a verb, as apposed to &quot;avenge&quot;.  That being said, it&apos;s a pretty tight game otherwise.)  To do so, you must destroy the fortress on the very last level. When you start the game and it scrolls onto the starting screen, the background contains the different levels that you must survive. The starting position of the various enemies does not vary from game to game.</desc>

Twin Eagle II - The Rescue Mission (c) 1994 Seta Company, Limited.

Twin Eagle II is a vertical scrolling shooter where one or two players pilot heavily armed helicopters through three stages with three areas each.

At the start of each stage, the players select their path of attack through the three areas.  Areas with ground level enemies and targets are presented in a 3/4 isometric view, while areas with no ground targets feature scrolling landscape images.  Players use their guns to attack flying enemy aircraft and bombs to attack ground targets such as tanks, rocket launchers and high-rise skyscrapers.  If things get too hairy, the player can use a missile barrage to clear the screen of enemies and enemy firepower.  Destroying some buildings reveal primary colored trucks which drop weapon power-ups and point items when destroyed.  Each area features a boss at the end, which must be destroyed to advance past the area.  The final stage features one additional boss before the end of the game.</desc>

Twin Bee (c) 1985 Konami.

Twin Bee is an overhead scrolling game starring a pair of bee-shaped robots, Twinbee (the blue one) and his female counterpart Winbee (the pink one), Twin Bee is part of what are called &apos;cute &apos;em ups&apos;, a slang for shoot-em-up games that feature cute characters, animals and other funny looking creatures, among other whimsical themes and brightly colored landscapes. It&apos;s a fun game to play with at least 6 stages that repeat themselves with increased difficulty as you go along.

Power-ups and extra points can be found in special bells hidden in some enemies that, when shot a certain number of times, will change color and then, when touched by the player, will provide a powerup, such as extra speed.</desc>

Twinkle Star Sprites (c) 1997 SNK.

Twinkle Star Sprites is a competitive scrolling shooter game originally created by ADK. It was ADK&apos;s last production for the Neo-Geo platform. The gameplay, which can be characterized as a combination of a fixed shooter and a versus puzzle game, uses combinations of shots, as well as timed power-ups to attempt to damage the opponent. These attacks also serve as counters to the opponent&apos;s attack.

An interesting &amp; highly cute hybrid between a Vs style puzzle game &amp; an overhead shooter, players may choose to play the Story Mode in order to see the misadventures of Load Ran &amp; her faithful yet somewhat annoying Rabbicat as they try to find the Magical Twinkle Star &amp; save their world from the evil Mevious &amp; his henchmen. The other option is to play the Free Character Mode in which you are able to pick any character (see codes under Tips and Tricks) to play the game and see their very own comical ending. A second player may challenge you at any time.</desc>

Venture (c) 1981 Exidy.

Venture is a 1- or 2-player &quot;Gauntlet&quot; style game (although Venture pre-dates the Atari legend by 4 years) set in a multi-level dungeon. The player, armed with a bow and arrow fights through enemy infested levels in the quest to collect treasure.

Each dungeon is represented as a floor plan, populated with a number of &quot;Space Invader&quot; like monsters. Numerous rooms and their corresponding doors are clearly marked; these rooms are the treasure rooms and each one must be cleared. When the player enters a room, the viewpoint zooms in on the action and the room takes up the whole screen. Each room has a treasure or weapon guarded by one or more creatures. Players must try to retrieve the treasure while avoiding (or killing) creatures and obstacles. Only in the rooms themselves can players use their bow and arrow.

When the treasure is successfully taken out of the chamber, bonus points are awarded. The screen image then returns to the original, zoomed-out floor plan and the player moves on to the next room of their choice. Once a room has been cleared of its item, the player no longer has access to that room. The player must collect all of the treasures on the current level before descending to another dungeon.</desc>

Vimana (c) 1991 Toaplan.

Players control their ship over a constantly scrolling background; the scenery never stops moving until the final level is reached. Players have three weapons at their disposal: the standard shot, a charge shot and a bomb weapon.

The standard shot weapon is a twin-shot weapon capable of strengthening in size and power with upgrades. However, the player has to tap the fire button to fire rapidly; once the button is held down, the ship charges a stronger version of the normal shot capable of spreading out across the entire screen in twelve directions. The player’s bomb weapon, the Circle Bomb, encircles the ship once activated and seeks out enemies upon an additional tap of the bomb button.

There are a total of four items for the player to pick up shot strength, circle bomb, points, and and extra life.</desc>

Virtua Fighter (c) 1993 Sega.

In this 3-D fighting game, the game&apos;s battle system is simple, yet complex. There are 3 buttons: Punch, Kick and Guard. Movement is strictly confined to a horizontal plane.

Battles are won by draining the energy bar of your opponent or by pushing your opponent off the edges of the ring (known as a &apos;Ring-out&apos;).

When a &apos;Draw&apos; is declared (timer reaches zero with both fighters having an equal amount of energy), a Sudden Death match is held on a very small platform, making a win by Ring-out that much more probable.

The game favours tactical play over mindless button bashing, and the gameplay is balanced accordingly to reflect this.</desc>

Vs. The Goonies (c) 12/1986 Konami.

A platform game based on the 1985 Steven Spielberg movie of the same name. The player takes control of Mikey and must explore a variety of caverns and rooms, searching for the three keys needed to unlock the huge, metal door that bars progress to the next level. The keys are hidden behind a number of doors which can only be removed by placing a bomb in front of them and blowing them open. Mikey&apos;s progress is hampered by the many enemies that roam the levels. The bombs needed to blow the doors appear when certain enemies are killed.

A fellow &apos;Goonie&apos; is trapped behind one of the doors on each level, and can be rescued, although this isn&apos;t necessary to progress to the next level. A catapult, or &apos;slingshot&apos;, can also be found, allowing Mikey to attack enemies from a safe distance.</desc>

Warlords (c) 1981 Atari.

Atari&apos;s Warlords depicts a third-person view of four castles. The player-controlled Warlords and computer-controlled Black Knights use shields to defend their castle walls from the fireballs that ricochet around the playfield. 

Players can capture and catapult the fireballs at opposing castles, using their shield control and &apos;Power Stone&apos; pushbutton. When a fireball hits a castle wall, it destroys one or more bricks, depending on its speed. 

A castle not paid for is controlled by the computer, with a Black Knight displayed in the appropriate castle. The Black Knights catapult fireballs at the players with increasing accuracy, to provide challenge. 

Game play begins when any start button is pressed and the countdown has ended. The game ends when the last Warlord&apos;s castle (containing a crown) has been penetrated by a fireball. At this point a white cloud envelopes the crown, and the latter disappears. 

During the countdown, a dragon flies back and forth across the screen with a fireball in its mouth. At the end of the countdown, a position activated by a Start button has its Black Knight changed to a Warlord&apos;s crown. A position not activated remains as a Black Knight and is controlled by the computer. The dragon then spits the fireball from its mouth toward a Warlord&apos;s castle. 

The objective is to destroy the three other castles, while protecting one&apos;s own castle with the moving shield. The LED pushbuttons have dual functions: in the Ready-to-Play mode they work as Start switches, and during game play they become &apos;Power Stones&apos; to allow players to capture and catapult fireballs at opponents. 

The spinning fireballs released from a shield have more destructive force on a castle wall than a fireball simply deflected from another wall or the sides of the playfield. However, players will soon find out that they cannot hold onto a fireball for long, since it slowly destroys their own castle walls adjacent to the fireball. 

Additional fireballs appear at predetermined intervals or when a castle is destroyed, whichever comes first. A maximum of four fireballs simultaneously appear on the screen. 

In 1- and 2-player games, the Warlords&apos; crowns will be accompanied by a zero, to begin scoring. The point-scoring system is printed on each control panel (the Black Knights do not score points). 

If a Black Knight has the surviving castle, the game ends. However, if a Warlord has the surviving ca</desc>

Warrior Blade - Rastan Saga Episode III (c) 1992 Taito Corporation.

Warrior Blade is a fantasy-themed hack-and-slash game for one or two players, featuring both horizontal and vertically scrolling levels. Unlike previous Rastan games that featured only Rastan himself, players can now choose to play as one of three different warriors: Rastan, Dewey (a hireling) or Sophia (a thief).

Players must then fight their way through a multitude of enemy-packed levels set in a variety of different locations, such as castles, a forest, a swamp and on board a sinking ship. Certain levels also have the players riding on animals, such as horses and dragons. Coins and treasure items can be found in the numerous barrels and chests that litter the levels, as well as being dropped by some defeated enemies. Bonus points and vitality - depending on the amount of treasure collected - are awarded upon the level&apos;s completion.

As well as coins and treasure, other bonus items can be found that give weapon and magical-weapon power-ups, as well as extra vitality (health).

Level progression through the game is not linear. After the very first level, &apos;Depon Road&apos;, players are presented with a map of the Kingdom, and can choose which of four different routes they wish to take next. The available routes are; Castle (Northwest), Tower (Northeast), Ship (Southwest) and Palace (Southeast).</desc>

Wild Fang (c) 1989 Tecmo.

Wild Fang is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players with a medieval setting. Players take on a variety of orcs, ogres, demons and other mythical creatures in their bid to destroy Satan, decapitating each enemy they encounter in order to collect their skulls for points and power-ups.

The player&apos;s character is an armor wearing beastmaster who sits atop of a fist-fighting giant.  Upon the player&apos;s command, the player may switch his mount into a tiger and attack with his mace.  Within each stage, there are also power-ups that allow the player to morph into a laser breathing dragon for a limited period of time.

The player&apos;s life bar is represented by a fire breathing dragon in the upper corner.  With each hit the player takes, the fire breath grows smaller.  Once the life bar is depleted the player&apos;s mount is killed and the player travels on foot and fights with throwing daggers.  If hit in this form then the player loses a life.  The game is over when all of a players lives are lost.</desc>

Wonder Boy in Monster Land (c) 1987 Sega.

Wonder Boy in Monster Land is a multi-directional scrolling platform hack &apos;n&apos; slash game with RPG elements, in which the game&apos;s hero, Wonder Boy, has seen his home of Wonderland invaded by the evil &apos;MEKA Dragon&apos; and its army of minions. 

At the start of the game Wonder Boy is unarmed, but the mayor of Wonder Land (as it was known before the invasion) gives him a short sword to help him in his quest. Wonder Boy has a life meter represented as a series of red hearts and whenever he sustains damage, the hearts deplete. When all the hearts are depleted, Wonder Boy dies and the game ends. As well as the life meter, there is also an Hourglass Timer at the top of the screen; whenever this runs out, Wonder Boy loses some life. The Timer can be refilled by collecting hourglasses or by visiting hospitals or taverns.

Enemies can be killed by being stabbed with the sword, with many requiring multiple hits. Bags of gold and gold coins can be found (either dropped by some defeated enemies, or appearing when players jump in certain spots) for use in the shops that appear in each stage. Players can buy upgrades to Wonder Boy&apos;s boots (for better jumping and faster running speed), shield and armour. 

As well as gold and coins, there are many other items located throughout the game. These include necklaces, harps, mirrors and crowns that increase the player&apos;s score; hearts that refill the life meter; gauntlets that temporarily double Wonder Boy&apos;s attack power; helmets that temporarily provide additional protection from enemy attacks; Winged Boots that allow Wonder Boy to fly over obstacles; Revival Potions and magic mantles that make Wonder Boy temporarily invisible. Other special items hidden in the game which the player must find include letters, the flute, various charms, the bell and the ruby.

Wonder Boy in Monster Land is divided into twelve levels for players to battle through to reach the Meka Dragon, and each has its own unique features, items, monsters and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Most stages include a boss that once defeated, leaves behind a key to the next stage. Defeating a boss also strengthens Tom-Tom&apos;s sword.</desc>

World Court - Pro Tennis (c) 10/1988 Namco.

Tennis sports arcade game released by Namco, and inspired by the 1987 Famicom game Family Tennis.

At the start of the game the players must select either &quot;singles&quot; (Player 1 v Player 2) or &quot;doubles&quot; (Player Team v CPU Team).  They must then select one of twenty different players (ten male, eight female and two robot) before selecting one of three different courts (New York City hard, London lawn, and Paris clay). They must then select whether they want the match to be one or three sets long - and, once they have done so, their two (or four) chosen players will come out, and take their positions on the court. The players must use an eight-way joystick to direct their chosen players around their half of the court and two buttons to hit the ball with their rackets. But just like in a real tennis match, faults, net balls and deuce can occur (but the &quot;Deuce&quot; setting in the options menu can be turned off).</desc>

World Rally (c) 1993 Gaelco.

World Rally is a road rally-themed driving game. Licensed by Gaelco of Barcelona, Spain, it is suitable for both street and arcade locations. World Rally is a 1- or 2-player alternating driving game. Controls include a steering wheel on a mounting pod, a high/low gear shifter assembly, and an accelerator pedal.

Players select 1 of 4 rallies to start, each progressively more difficult than the one before. A rally is composed of three stages, offering a variety of different track layouts and road surfaces. Asphalt, dirt, night driving and snow-covered roads require players to adjust their driving skills accordingly.

Players maneuver their way through hairpin curves, jumps, bridges, puddles, and other obstacles. Completing each stage within the 60-second time limit allows players to advance to the next stage for free. After the finish of each stage, and at the completion of all 12 stages, players&apos; times are displayed and compared with other top drivers.</desc>

X-Multiply (c) 1989 Irem Corp.

The game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249—the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen.

The game itself is a side-scroller like R-Type, albeit with a short vertical-scrolling area towards the end of the sixth level. Instead of the Force pod, however, the main power-up apparatus takes the form of two flexible tentacles. The tentacles are invulnerable to all enemy attacks, and can be positioned with careful maneuvering of the X-002.</desc>

X-Men (c) 1992 Konami.

X-Men is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for up to four players. The X-Men&apos;s mission is to find and rescue Professor X, who has been captured by evil mutants and is now being held prisoner by Magneto.

Each X-Man character has an &apos;Attack&apos;, &apos;Jump&apos; and &apos;Mutant Power&apos; button. The mutant power attack is a powerful special move unique to each X-Man. While it inflicts a lot of damage on the enemies, the trade-off is that each usage removes 3 bars from the players health meter (a full meter has 10 bars). Each level ends with a face-off against a powerful mutant boss character.

The game has six stages, with the final one set on &apos;Asteroid M&apos;, Magneto&apos;s base. The defeated mutant bosses from the previous levels each make an appearance (albeit in a less powerful form) before the final encounter with Magneto himself.

Players can chose from 6 X-Men characters, they are:
Cyclops 
Colossus 
Wolverine 
Storm 
Nightcrawler 
Dazzler</desc>

Xexex (c) 1991 Konami.

Xexex is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which players pilot a ship called the &apos;Flintlock&apos; and must save the blue-haired Princess Irene of the planet E-Square from an evil lord named Klaus. 

The player&apos;s ship has a detachable orb attachment called the Flint, which behaves in a similar fashion to the &apos;Force Device&apos; from Irem&apos;s &quot;R-Type&quot; series. Power-ups can be obtained to increase the Flint&apos;s power, movement speed, change the main weapon, or even give the player an extra life.

The player starts the game armed with the Proton Laser, which emits thin stream of weak bullets. Defeating certain enemies will drop other weapons:
* Homing Laser: A 3-way laser with weak &quot;bending&quot; homing for top and bottom lasers.
* Shadow Laser: A laser beam that creates a damage-inflicting shadow as the ship moves up and down. 
* Round Laser: An unusual spread shot (different from the overseas version&apos;s main weapon)
* Spiral Laser: A spiral laser of considerable width.
* Search Laser: A laser with strong homing that travels in square trajectories.
* Ground Laser: Fires an upgraded Proton Laser along with a laser beam that travels along the ground.

The name of the current weapon is displayed at the bottom of the screen. In the non-Japanese overseas versions, the only available weapon is the Proton Laser and picking up power-ups simply increases the spread of the weapon. Missiles are a secondary weapon.</desc>

Yie Ar Kung-Fu plays incredibly quickly, with the player having to be constantly on the move to avoid getting &apos;pegged in&apos; by some of the game&apos;s tougher opponents. There is no time limit in which the opponent must be defeated but Oolong possesses a finite amount of health, represented by a health bar at the top of the screen. Once Oolong&apos;s health is fully depleted, the match is over.

The first five fights take place in front of an animated waterfall, while the remaining six are set in front of an oriental pagoda. 

The eleven opponents Oolong must face are:
* Buchu - A sumo wrestler, strong but slow.
* Star - The first female opponent, throws shuriken for long-range attacks.
* Nuncha - Uses nunchaku for close and mid-range attacks.
* Pole - Uses a wooden staff for close and mid-range attacks.
* Feedle - Attacks with duplicates of himself.
* Chain - Uses a chain for long-range attacks.
* Club - Uses a large club for close and mid-range attacks.
* Fan - The second female opponent, throws fans for long-range attacks.
* Sword - Uses a sword for close and mid-range attacks.
* Tonfun - Uses tonfa (wooden batons) for close and mid-range attacks.
* Blues - Extremely fast and very powerful.</desc>

Zektor (c) 1982 Sega.

Zektor is a one- or two-player game that tasks you with the liberation of eight cities that have been seized by the evil cadre of alien robots. In order to liberate a city, you must defeat three attack waves of fighters and robo-probes. Fighters and Robo-probes are often shielded (in red), and each consecutive hit reduces the enemies shield strength, until, when the shield drops, a hit will destroy it. In addition, you will encounter three types of Moboids:
* Green Moboids spin the players ship on contact, and bounce enemy ships.
* Blue Moboids bounce all ships.
* Red Moboids destroy all un-shielded ships (including the players ship).

After defeating three attack waves, the Alien Robot holding that city will reappear within rotating protective rings, through which a &apos;slot shot&apos; neutralizes that Robot, awarding the player a bonus ship and advancement to the next round.</desc>
