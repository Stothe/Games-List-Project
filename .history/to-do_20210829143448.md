Here's a place to store some ideas I'd like to work on 

Integrate catver.ini data using the same functions that adds nplayer.ini

Once that's in investigate if we can build gamelists without a donor gamelist.xml file

Build a CSS file

Filter out play choice 10 games

Option to hide brackets in game titles

Output lists to more file types

Elegantly handle "useful" clones (eg, 2p versions of 4p games)

Nifty loading screens

Converting the app to a WordPress plugin
